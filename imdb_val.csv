Review,Sentiment
"The hype, enthusiasm, technology, acting skills, not to mention the iconic doll that promised a fantastic movie does not live up, sorry to say, to the incredibly inane writing of this film.",0
I went into this film as part of a date and had no idea what to expect but went into it with an open mind and really wanted to like it.,0
"Such a silly, beautiful, wonderful movie! This is truly a cinematic masterpiece. It has heart, soul, and lots of laughs. I've seen it twice so far and it honestly gets better with each watch. I'm looking forward to owning it when it comes out for purchase as well. This will definitely be one I watch a lot. Ryan Gosling's Ken is everything, and he's absolutely perfect. This entire movie is perfect. I don't want to say too much and spoil anything for those that haven't seen it yet, so just go ahead and do yourself a favor and go see it. What are you waiting for? P. S. Isn't not ""sexist"" it's making a point, and people that have a problem with what it's saying should probably ask themselves why and look inwards.",1
This movie was so unexpected.,1
"I laughed, I felt understood, I felt touched. It's so relatable as a woman and as person trying to navigate this world. It made me remind me as child and me now, as a 24 year old woman. I liked it more than I was anticipating. Great movie. The ""ask him about the Godfather"" was sending me. And the whole monologue about the contradictory expectations of womanhood, it was too relatable. Everything America Ferrera's character said, everything. The movie also touches on what it means to be a person, and the ending when Barbie decides she wants to experience what it's like to be human, it was also very touching. Also when Ken realises his idendity shouldn't revolve around Barbie. I don't give it a 10 cause I don't consider it perfect, but it's very close to it.",1
"This movie was definitely made for everybody. It had hilarious scenes and a few sad ones. And I was always told when a movie makes you laugh and cry, it's a great movie. The plot and message was unexpected, in a good way though. I could also tell that it touched people. In the theatre, I heard "" oh my god,"", sniffles, and gasps. The cast and acting was off the top and the detail was, too. Although, you may here some comments saying, "" Oh this movie is sexist against men,"". You really have to see the movie to understand it. The people that are saying those things, obviously have not seen the movie. It's just so good, I would be able to watch this everyday. It is definitely worth the money to see it.",1
"Unlike most movies that come out,
Barbie is a fun adaptation and an excellent movie.",1
"""Barbie"": Greta Gerwig's new film manages to be extremely creative and original while, at the same time, a bit generic. The film starts strong with an impeccable introduction referencing ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and then transitions to the gigantic dollhouse that is Barbieland. The production design is simply incredible, the use of CGI is imperceptible, the practical effects are great, the costumes are unique, and the makeup and hair contribute to the excellent art direction. The performances are all good, especially those of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who as Ken manage to steal the scenes several times. The weakest point lies in the script, which hits and misses at every moment. Its execution is good, the story itself works well, even without explaining some details. Nothing comes close to hindering the experience. Greta aims to deliver strong critiques and attempts to remain neutral, but at a specific moment, she forces it too much, causing a disconnection with the viewer. In the following scene, there's a spectacular sequence involving Ken, creating a sensation that his storyline is better. It's not; it's just more entertaining. The only ""weak"" storyline is that of the human mother-daughter duo and the executives. It's one of the weaker aspects of a good, fun, exciting, and creative film, which falls short of being even better due to stumbling over its details.",1
"I was very surprise as the film turned out to be a very hollow matter. Why did they stretch the ""Hello Barbie""-""Hello Barbie"" joke all over the movie. Running gag? This film was so boring, the jokes so unadventurous, the characters so flat. The film was the look and feel of a 20 minute-TV-show stretched to infinity. Ryan Gosling was cool, but in the wrong movie. Margot Robbie is beautiful. That's it. She squeezed exactly one characteristic out of the puppet. After watching the film a would have assumed it would make 20 bio at the box office. What was I wrong.",0
To see a universe that's a Barbie world where the Barbies are the rulers and the Kens are just there to support Barbie brings our universe into focus. Ken doesn't feel loved and respected or important in the Barbie world. He steps into the real world where men are respected and many thing revolves around them and he realizes that he can be more. I hope that this movie could help men feel more empathy towards women and the way this world makes them feel less valuable and important. Women couldn't own property before and in Barbie world Kens didn't have a home to call their own or any important positions.,1
"Was thrilled at start. What with all the pinks and blues and wow the reference to "" Planet of the Apes"" and ""Thus spake Zarathustra"". Somehow Greta or the writer did not know how to proceed after the Ken takeover and ended it all with almost a Christian sermon, however feminist it may sound and gave an American ending of all's well. Had expected more.",1
"Thank you for this movie ! It's beautiful by the d√©cor, costumes and music, but so much more beautiful with the message. We do need that kind of movie in our world.",1
"'Barbie (2023)' truly is an accomplishment, a shockingly successful blend between a mass-appeal blockbuster and a strange slice of surreal existentialism. There isn't anything quite like it and, although it essentially serves as one giant advertisement for its eponymous doll, it feels like a genuine piece of almost outsider art with a great sense of humour and a ton of heart. It's an incredibly well-crafted feature. The cinematography, set design and costuming all hit the nail squarely on the head, to the point that the pastel plastic aesthetic of Barbieland is so compelling and so complete that it honestly feels as though the movie has become live-action once Barbie and Ken make their way to the real world (even though the flick has been live-action since its first frame). The performances help with this, too, as the actors not only throw themselves from head to toe into the absurdity needed to fully embody the unreal nature of their characters but also deliver their lines with pitch-perfect timing and genuine emotion. All the Barbies and all the Kens (and Allan) are great, but Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling truly are the stars here. The former is absolutely brilliant, nailing the emotional dichotomy of her character's mindset as she undergoes her journey, and the latter just seems as though he's having a great time, living that quintessential Ken lifestyle without an ounce of embarrassment. It's also nice to see Will Ferrell being funny again, popping up as a CEO who seems like he just might be Buddy the Elf all grown up (it's not like he ever stopped being funny, per se, but he's been in some rough movies recently), and America Ferrera is great in her more down-to-Earth yet refreshingly honest role.",1
"Barbie directed by Greta Gerwig introduces us to Stereotypical Barbie played by Margot Robbie having yet another perfect day in Barbieland an utopia where all its inhabitants are dolls, living in their pink dreamhouses with no exterior walls. Each day in Barbieland is a perfect day. However one day Barbie shows signs of being a human and is asked to go to the human world to figure out who's playing with her and fix everything. Along the way she discovers the joys and perils of living amongst humans and where she's truly meant to be.",1
"I loved the first part of this movie. There is a a lot of excitement, wonder, meaning and humor. The main actors are very good and it all seems to be going so well. Barbie is looking for the girl who owned her in the real world. Ken hides in the back seat and comes along. At a certain point the movie becomes a story about the patriarchy suppressing women. There are some long speeches that really do not have a lot of emotional impact. At the start of the movie Ken is a puppet in Barbie world where Barbie controls everything, then it seems like they try to make the point that men and women don't need eachother and I don't think that is right. I think the movie should have been more fair to how men and women can be a great team in stead of being individuals and at odds. All in all I liked the movie, but it could have been better. If I'm saying that because I am a man and just don't get the plights of womanhood, then I'm sorry, but my experience in my own life is that it's not easy to be a man in this world of hours, I don't believe it's the case that men have all the advantages. Ken constantly confess his love to Barbie, but the movie says that his love is not real because he doesn't own Barbie. This to me does not represent men well. When I look around in the society I live in, I don't see men who own their women. I see men and women who love eachother and want to live together and I don't see what's wrong with that. I guess it would just be too traditional if that was the conclusion in this movie.",1
"Barbie movies have always been an embodiment of women empowerment and creativity in the Barbie beautifully continues this tradition. With its captivating storyline and empowering messages, this animated gem is a delightful treat for both kids and adults alike.",1
Barbie 2023 movie really surprised me. I mean wow soo freaking cool and dope. Margot Robbie really plays Barbie so well! I loved it. Based on the real life Barbie doll toys of course made by the Toy company Mattel. Also Ken was fried and Barbie's boyfriend and sidekick. Will Ferrell aka Elf was also in it so cool too! I actually liked the Barbie movie it was funny and cute enjoyable to actually watch. If your a Barbie fan I would definitely would recommend watching of course!,1
"As a skeptical viewer, I went into this expecting cheesy bad. I am happy to say that this movie is fun! Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. It's a great mixture of adult humor and fun and kids humor and fun without ever feeling like it dives into one or the other too much. There's surprisingly a beautiful emotional sequence TWICE and it delivers a great message while poking fun at Barbie and Mattel. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling prove to be the amazing actors they are known for and this is packed with a great supporting cast. Yes the plot is thin, yes it's a little bare bones and yes there's some minor pacing things here and there. But for what it is I liked this movie a lot. I will be watching again on streaming!",1
"I never would have gone to see this movie if it weren't for a friend showing up to a party and telling me that it was a masterpiece. She described it as high art, which to me is high praise. After seeing it, I agree. It has all of the qualities of high art in that it is bound to be confusing to some, interpreted differently, and will inspire great feelings positive and negative depending on the viewer.",1
"This plot of Barbie unexpected, I watched it with no real expectations and no other knowledge about what it would be like. Barbie took me by surprise at it had a super deep and meaningful plot on being a woman, what the barbie life is like vs what it actually is like to be a woman. Plus the ken parts were super hilarious, the whole cinema was falling out of our seats at Ryan Gosling, he played Ken so well. And it was great to have these funny moments through out, when some of the parts were more serious. But I wish it had more barbie references, maybe from the movies which is such a memory for me growing up, but it seemed to focus more on Barbies with jobs trying to show that Girls can grow up to do anything, but I guess they couldn't cater to everything as it might've been to hard to squeeze it all it.",1
It's impressive how so many messages were cleverly conveyed through a well-known brand.,1
"I was mostly expecting a fun comedy but this turned out to be such a superb meta monster, the likes of which I hadn't seen since original Deadpool movie... And then the cast, script & visuals of Barbie went farther into some insightful, biting & modern thematic territories.",1
"It is funny, it is deep, it is nostalgic, it is not about romance, it is all the things the doll was meant to be.",1
"I really don't know what to say about this movie . Everything was colorful, the humor was there , the satire and everybody did great at what they were suppose to do . I went in there with low expectations because it's a Barbie film but I was surprised how adult the humor was and the message it got across was pretty touching . Margot Robbie as Barbie was perfect casting and the theatre was filled , everybody had a good time . I should give this score maybe a bit higher but I just felt it was just a bunch of things mashed together I was watching a parody episode of South Park which is not a bad thing , I though it was the right direction for a movie called Barbie . It was weird to me but in a very good way and LOL at the ending , made everybody laugh . Check it out , I say it's worth a view in the theatre.",1
"When I sat down to watch this film I assumed it would be some fun pink silly movie but it was not in the best possible way. It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive. The perfect Barbie.",1
"An film that tries to balance out humor and leaving social criticism in the minds of the viewers. Barbie falls flat with its criticism not only because it feels flat and out of place, but most importantly unnatural and unimportant.",0
"When we saw the trailer for this movie I knew that my wife was going to want to see it. I really wanted this to be a fun movie and figured it would poke fun at itself a bit. Ryan Gossling and Morton Robbie did a great job as actors. But they were not given a cohesive script and story line. This movie was all over the place. It was not fun and it never is when you are watching overlong dialog, songs, and dance routines. I'm not sure I can even explain the main storyline of this movie. Is that Barbie wants to be real? Does she want to help the girl, now woman that used to play with her fix the relationship with her daughter. Was it about Ken not wanting to exist as an accessory? Overall, this was not fun, funny and ended up being tedious and actually boring. This is not a movie for little girls and it is not a movie for adults either. This is a really big missed opportunity.",0
"As a man who has never touched a barbie in my life, I was definitely not the intended audience for this film. However, I absolutely enjoyed it. It's funny, entertaining, and poignant. I came in thinking it would be sort of silly and fun, which it was, but it also was about barbie, an always-positive ""person's"" journey into the real world and how messed up and unfair it is. She believes that the real world must be just like hers, where women are recognized for their achievements and always given the opportunity, respect, and tools to succeed in life. She is obviously very disappointed in our world when she actually experiences it. I think any guy tagging along to see this will enjoy it unless he's a misogynist and/or very insecure in his masculinity.",1
"This movie is many things. One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.",1
When I first walked into the cinema to watch this movie my first expectation is just for it to be funny and fun pink bling bling stuff but I should've expected a more deeper meaning to this movie when it's a Greta Gerwig movie.,1
"Very entertaining, and fun. Does not take itself too seriously. Very good satirical acting. Props, and set building is very creative and in-depth. Ryan Gosling is great, and really funny. The plot and message are annoying though. Starts from the beginning with a very delusional message, and does not let up. Even though I tried to ignore the very delusional message throughout, the ending makes no sense. Barbie herself ends up not solving her problem, still being confused, and staying in the real world when she wanted everything back to normal during the whole movie. That makes no sense whatsoever. The very last line of dialogue is a fail of a joke too. The director obviously did not know how to end the movie.",1
"I had high expextations for this Movie: Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, Perfect Casting, Ryan Gosling and then the First Trailer: Our hopes for this beeing something special were high. Yesterday, I saw the movie. It was so great, just so great, My God. Ken is just it. He is just it. Kenough said. You Just Need to buy a ticket, or two and go See it. Some people might Not understand the Movie, maybe your friends or family sitting next to you dont like it. But that is okay. Because you Just wittnessed something special, a historic moment in movie history and you felt it. You know it for sure. And then Barbie ends and all you want to do is Watch it again. Thank you for Making this movie. I will treasure it forever. Thank you, it was so much fun. This is the kend of My Review.",1
"My expectations were very low for the movie but I am surprised. The Movie was literally good, the cast were fantastic, the set up delivered the fabulousness of the B world! Margot Robbie is a great choice for Barbie. I hope to see some elements from lgbti+ but it did not bothered me at all. Planning to go and see again.",1
"Ever since I saw Lady Bird, I knew that I will love Greta and her style. It was so human and it spoke to me. So when Barbie was released, there was no doubt I will like this film-but not this much. In 114 minutes, Greta serves everything that she intended sending a beautiful positive message about womanhood. What it means to be human, what it means to live in this broken patriarchal system. The message is clear: to be human is to feel. This movie is funny. And as someone who is not a fan of American humor, that's a big one. But I laughed through the entire movie. I also shared a tear. I loved America's monologue about womanhood. I loved Dame Helen Mirren as a narrator-great choice. Margot is a star. Her Barbie is so authentic. She portrays comedy, as well as the emotional part of the character so well. That last scene was so good. Now I can't skip the star of the film, and that is Ryan Gossling. Ken was hilarious and I will quote him for the rest of my life. But also shows that Greta is sweet to men offering them compassion by showing them that they are enough as it is, they don't have to be more than that. Greta (and Noah), really made a beautiful love letter to womanhood by showing all the parts of it-please the scene with the old lady had my heart. Overall it's already classic and the movie, that will probably be one of my comfort movies.",1
Barbie is a fun summery movie for all ages.,1
"I'm not someone who often watches comedies, so they don't make me laugh much, but if they all became as funny as Barbie, I might give it another go.",1
"Barbie is a weird film that is pretty well made. It tells the story of how one of many Barbie's in Barbie-land leave and go into the real world to find the person who owns them as a toy. In the real world, they see what impact Barbie has, or fails to have, as a product on the minds of young girl consumers. This information changes her, and Ken's opinion of themselves and they return home and deal with the aftermath of this revelation.",1
"Barbie is a really refreshing movie! Directed with a truly unique style that brings the Barbie universe to life, it tackles deep topics (gender issues, consumerism...) with a lot of humor. It opens a lot of interesting conversations in a very new way, switching perspectives to let the viewer experience the irony of the world we live in today.",1
"Yet I loved the performances from both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, and the incredible aspects of feminism and battling misogyny, I felt untouched by the film at some points. Mainly most of the characters in the 'Real World' - For example; Will Ferrell's character was completely useless and didn't add much to the film as a whole, and DEAR GOD did Connor Swindells contribute absolutely nothing to this film. Personally it got to the point where I felt as if this film should've just been a biopic about Ruth Handler, plus Rhea Perlman's performance as Ruth Handler was just exciting and very heartfelt/heartwarming at the same time.",1
Gosling Robbie Made the movie. They're what makes it worthy to Watch. Every other possible meaning or message the director was aiming to Explore in the film was pointless or superficially / weakly face. Mattel tried so hard to wash its image through out Barbie's redemption that it almost appears cringe. Will Ferrell in the Same Role as he was in Zoolander or so. Finally the male figure is a bad represantation of the worst and stereotypical patriarchy which you could assist to maybe in the 80s. Despite Goslin's brilliant represantation Ken is just a stupid mamma boy without any merit. Robbie is just wonderful.,1
"The 2023 Barbie movie is a whimsical and colorful adventure that aims to entertain its target audience of children but falls somewhat short for a broader viewership, warranting a 6/10 rating.",1
"Barbie is such a fun time, the whole cast collectively deserve an award. Contrary to what some people are already claiming, this is not a men hating film, it is so much nuanced than that. In fact, by the film's conclusion it is clearly demonstrated why extremes wouldn't work, we all need each other and we need to learn how to coexist. I'm so glad this film had something to say. I can tell a certain faction of pea-brained individuals are absolutely gonna seethe when they see this film, and that just make me love it even more. I can't believe a movie like this got such a huge budget and is such a success.",1
"The script is well-written with engaging complexity, a remarkable script that transformed into an excellent film. All of the castings are top tier, I can't imagine another Barbie other than Margot. The sounds and visuals are admittedly not too prominent, but it also contributes significantly to the emotional orientation, which was done nicely. However, the film could have done better in developing the supporting characters. It's truly amazing that a film like this could do so well at the box office compared to other billion-dollar movies. And I think I'm not the only one hoping that there won't be a sequel, it's much better standing alone.",1
This movie did a lot of things good and a lot of things bad.,0
Ryan Gosling acting was so good that is seemed that he as Ken is the main character.,1
"I waited to see this on MAX to experience all the commotion, and if they never made the film ""Bolero,"" this would rank as the worst film ever made for me.",0
"Opposite of my expectations, overall I thought this movie was entertaining and pretty funny. Ryan Gosling was fantastic as Ken and the Ken's as a whole were really funny and my favorite part about the movie. The set design was knocked out of the park, it was the perfect look of Barbie land and it really immersed you in it. Lastly I thought the little details in the movie were awesome, like as if somebody was playing with Barbie like when she floats down from her house, the shower water is imaginary, and the drink she has at breakfast is imaginary. I love little details like that and Gerwig killed it with those.",1
"The movie isn't as fantastic as it was hyped to be. Its deconstruction of patriarchy and satire fall short of what was expected. Instead, it seems to remain on a rather superficial level of ""girls can do anything"" and ""find yourself."" The most controversial aspect of the Barbie character, whether it exacerbates women's appearance anxiety, is hardly mentioned at all. In my view, it's essentially a reiteration of the same old themes, just presented in updated ways. However, considering Hollywood's consistent conservatism and focus on profits, I appreciate that this is a brave attempt at expressing feminism within the world's most profit-driven film industry.",1
"As someone who has been a fan of Barbie since I was a little girl, this movie was an incredible journey. The set was beautiful, the cast was great, and the soundtrack amazing. My favourite part though was its commentary on feminism and how the patriarchy effects both women and men negatively. It was achieved in a light hearted and caring way. The original hopes and dreams of Barbie's existence are brought to life, as she is a doll to inspire girls and young women to be whoever they wish. In a world which does not always cater to women's needs, this film does a great job of holding us all accountable. We now live in a post-Barbie movie era, and I'm so excited to see what the future holds.",1
I love Greta Gerwig (and met her once and told her so!) but this is not her finest work.,0
When I'm going to see a movie I don't do research beforehand. I like to make up my own mind and hate spoilers. I didn't even have a look at the trailer in this case so I really didn't know what to expect from Barbie.,1
"This film exceeded all of my expectations A N D I was looking forward to seeing it. I wonder about any parents who might bring their children to see it expecting something quite different from what this film is. One hour fifty four minutes of fun from beginning to end. Satire, sarcasm , humor at every turn. Production values and acting off the charts good. I can't believe Mattel let them make the movie with complete artistic freedom. Think of Nicole Kidman in the AMC promo before a movie starts and says, "" Somehow heartbreak feels good in a place like this "". Well somehow watching a silly spoof like this movie feels great all the way through and even afterwards. I loved it and I am not surprised at the huge box office , this movie rocks.",1
"But was pleasantly surprised. I found it very emotional. Fabulous casting, dancing and soundtrack. My daughters 6 and 8 also loved it. My husband even went along and got a few laughs but ended up at the pub with my youngest because the cinema in general was too loud for her. I can see how it could upset and make people uncomfortable that are after a comedy seen through the eyes of a stereotypical comedy director, but that is what makes this movie so different. Definitely bring some tissues if you have any sort of mother-daughter relationship, both good, bad and in-between. I am so glad I could see a movie like this with my daughters.",1
"This was a very fun, very engaging premise. I don't know if I'd call it groundbreaking, since it's a little derivative of Toy Story and Extra Guy, but this definitely works. The scenery and cast are great, and the movie bristles with energy.",1
"The marketing for this movie was seriously unlike anything else Billie Eillish, Xbox, Aldo, Burger King? Nyx, Forever 21, google etc.",0
"Watched it twice and enjoyed it even more on the second watch. Definitely not the all-enlightening and god-saving movie to the feminist movement but it does touch on a lot of issues in such a beautiful, greta gerwig-esque way.",1
"This movie represents in such a beautiful way what it is like to be a woman, and the grief we might feel growing up as one. I was so incredibly touched.",1
I almost walked out but I was with my friends. I even wore a pink dress. I really wanted to like this movie but it was way too ridiculous for my liking. I should have known that it would be more for barbie fans but I was never really into Barbie.,0
I'm a little lost as to who the target audience is.,0
"I tend to gravitate towards French cinema and the classics; the idea of watching a franchise movie about Barbie seemed mildly repellent at first. Well, I am glad I kept an open mind.",1
"Oh my goodness, where do I even begin with ""Barbie"" (2023)? This film is an absolute delight and a true masterpiece that will leave you in awe. Directed by the incredibly talented Greta Gerwig and starring the stunning Margot Robbie as the iconic doll herself, ""Barbie"" is a cinematic experience like no other.",1
"I have been waiting for this to release for so long and I finally got to watch it today. I absolutely loved it! It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers! What more could you want from a new summer classic?",1
"Its like watching at ""Truman's show"" but all the set it's pink color with a hint of extreme feminist ideas. I grew up with barbie dolls and I felt very disappointed, I was expecting a different kind of story, the ending was the worst. I think the message should be more with the real feminist concept of Simone de Bouvoir, we all deserve the same rights. In the end Instead of just Barbie Land they should changed as; Barbie and Ken Land.",1
First impressions of the movie where mixed. The script is pretty much garbage. It sends a solid message about equality while somehow does the exact opossite.,1
"I enjoyed the creation of the Barbie world, the costumes, set design, and I think the angle they took in terms of themes was interesting and relevant. The script, however, was not that solid.",1
"Wasn't sure how it would go however so much funnier then i expected, and definitely more of an adult film then i expected too, thought it was going to be aimed at the barbie loving 4 year olds however lots of laugh's throughout both jokes and other little subtle jokes like the CEO with his pink drum sticks and not being able to get through the locked gate with his swipe card as Barbie hops over the top and loved how it flipped between Barbie world and the normal world. Would highly recommend and would totally go back and see again and buy once out. Loved how everyone also gets in barbie theme and go dressed in pink.",1
"The movie started on the light side and fun, but the longer it went on the more preachy it became. It seemed the movie could not make up its mind if it was going to be a light and a fun movie or a heavy teaching a life lesson movie. This gives the viewer a roller coaster type viewing, where you are laughing a little (not a lot), but then the movie goes into a long, life lesson on how men are bad, and not very smart, but somehow they run the real world. Women are the real smart ones and the real world needs to change to match Barbie world. This changes the whole movie from just a fun time to head beating lesson, which takes a lot of the fun out of it. Too bad.",0
"I enjoyed this movie a lot, but there were also some parts in the storyline that didn't make sense or lacked depth.",1
"A fun experience leading up to Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" was, of course, the marketing campaign and the internet excitement leading up to the film. To me, the success of the movie is so fun since everyone, at least where I am from, was so excited to see it. Thankfully, it think it was worth it. The film succeeds on some levels, most particularly the comedy, performances, and production design. The soundtrack with countless artists and produced by Mark Robson is very fitting as well.",1
"A fantastic fun summer movie! Barbie is not at all
What I thought it would be. We laughed through the entire movie. Margot Robbie is absolutely perfect as well as America Ferrera. Ryan Gosling plays ken so well with a great twist. The movie had a lot of laughs along with an amazing message. It's hard to be a women and Barbie really shares a perspective that I think most women feel everyday. This is an important show for both females and males to see. I went into the movie with no expectations and came out thrilled and wanting to see it again. I've seen a lot of film this summer and this was my favorite so far!",1
"Great movie. Great casting. Margot Robbie as barbie is just beautiful and Ryan Gosling as ken is just amazing. A fresh movie with humour and sarcasm directly on society. Watch only if you can handle the tone of sarcasm. Ending can be confusing, it depends on your view, I was expecting rather different ending that maybe baribe would go other way but it is subjective. Watch if you want to experience a fresh sarcasm blast on thinking on society. At some point it feels like the points are targeted at only one person but it is not.",1
"I loved this move. It was very fun, light-hearted, and was just about the right length in terms of runtime for me to enjoy it casually. Excellent family movie overall. The use of practical effects was such a compelling part of how the set designs really came alive in the film in a way that made you feel immersed in it.",1
"Taking the joy and levity of the Mattel dynasty that is Barbie, and throwing the perfect figure into real world social issues creates an excellent fish-out-of-water plot. Addressing gender issues in a bright and (mostly) light-hearted manner gives the film an excellent moral without becoming preachy. Anyone vehemently against messages transmitted in the film must have strong opinions on whether these issues are a reality, as there is nothing controversial here, just a doll tackling common sense.",1
"My childhood was spent with Barbie, Barbie's films and dolls, bag, clothes and notebook...and now I'm so happy and grateful. Watching this movie tooks me back to my sweet childhood memories. Everything was that I expected. Pink world and lots of beautiful Barbie's and handsome Ken's gathered together. And it's interesting that just as we played with our dolls, the Barbies in the movie were also taken into play! Then one of my childhood dreams that was Barbie in the real world came true and it was interesting to me...
How wonderful it is that Margot Robbie was chosen to perform this role.. She did it perfectly.",1
"I saw this film with an open mind. I was ready for it to be enjoyable in some sort of way, either visually, through the actors, perhaps a fun story, or just turning off the brain and seeing what they came up with. Unfortunately, it struck out on all accounts. The much hyped visual experience and world building got old fast. The actors were so clich√©d and pigeonholed that they were hard to watch (as you may have heard, Ryan Gosling is the star and most interesting character despite the movie name). The movie was not fun after the first 15 minutes. In fact, it was intentionally written to be painful and to express the writer/director's personal concerns. We were supposed to be frustrated but were not rewarded with any payoff at the end.",0
"BARBIE is a film I find incredibly difficult to both review and rate. On the face of it, the trappings are pitiful and the tone is all over the place. The audience I saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable (like Gosling bouncing off the plastic wave) and missing all of the depth, which is what I personally found appealing. It's very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it's deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al. Despite this, the film's skewering of the patriarchy is spot-on, and Gosling turns out to be very good, stealing the film from the others. So it's a film I appreciate some parts of, and not others.",1
"Finally got around to viewing this, and it was really great fun. A solid story. It's Aldus Huxley's 'Brave New World' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', done with lots of pink and lots of music and dancing, far more than I expected.",1
"Barbie, like The Lego Movie, is a product film based on a product so successful it doesn't need to sell said product and instead uses the guaranteed exposure to tell its own fairly unique story.",1
"If it matters for an age perspective, I'm 32. I really wanted to like this movie, but it was disappointing. The actors did a good job with what they were given, and the Barbieland costumes and set design were great. But it was a poor storyline. Being a comedy, there were only about 3 moments that I found funny. I noticed the audience in the theater didn't laugh much either. I think the advertising for this was better than the actual film. The media really hyped this movie up and of course currently all the major headlines are rave reviews. But it's definitely not worth the hype. I know I won't ever watch this movie again.",0
"I don't understand all the criticism. I thought it was great. I don't think it's too preachy, I think it's educational and smart. I feel like I learned a lot and I hope other people did too. I heard someone say that the barbie movie Barbie said so many things yet said nothing at all. Meaning it should have been bolder. But I think it said a lot. It doesn't tell you what to think but it's a reflection of the real world that we live in. I'll probably rewatch it just to hear the dialog properly. And I loved the fashion. It made me feel more confident in being a grown woman and not a baby or a teen. It's kind of grownup outfits yet it doesn't hide the fact that women wants to be pretty amd wear high heels, and that it makes them happy.",1
"This film thinks it's the Lego Movie but is far more akin to Don't Worry Darling. Starting off in a Matriarchal society, '60s feminist paradise where every position in society is ran by women (this is never shown as oppressive or questionable) saturated with the neon pinks and pastel purples, quintessentially American and girly. All Kens are sidelined and have no meaning they are jealous of one another and simp over Barbie. Through the course of the film this paradigm is spun on its head and put back to how it was again, no fantastical change happens to this world once it is changed and fought over and won back again by the Barbies.",0
"Watching Greta Gerwig's interpretation of womanhood through universal icon, Barbie, was a beautiful and uniting experience.",1
"I saw this movie tonight and it was very entertaining but if your a parent and have young Children THEY WILL GET BORED as this is not a kids movie, it is on a higher intellectual plain than that. You could honestly say this is a movie for feminists, now thats not a bad thing as I saw it with my daughter and have always encouraged her to be whoever she wanted to be and played with Barbie when she was young (she's 23 now) .",1
"I feel like I have never watched anything like this before. Its so original, witty, entertaining, satiric, while also dealing with some important and serious issues culturally. I would recommend everyone to watch it, and Im so happy that this exist for future generations to come, to grow up with. It hits so many issues spot on, and with so much humor at the same time. I've never seen these feminist issues being taking up, in such a good way and in such a popular big art piece.",1
"I Love this one so much!! Movie of the year!!! Most men here will criticize and give it a bad grade, but you have no idea how much a film like this can touch the heart of every mother, daughter and girl who loves Barbie dolls in the whole world, it is moving to watch all of this, besides that final scene only serves to show the struggle that women have always suffered their whole lives and that their daughters and those who will come in the future will suffer. A film that sends such an important message is extremely important to us. I laughed and cried so much, was such a lovely experience, i wish i could watch again but this time with my mom.",1
"The movie in my opinion is great, it's no Godfather but it's a movie about BARBIE it's supposed to be fun, easy going and delightful but also amazingly brings up the problems of todays women and MEN. It has a great portrayal of the difference between the barbie world and the real human world. The characters are weirdly relatable and understandable. Margot Robbie was the best pick for barbie and Ryan as Ken ( even tho some may disagree, but no just watch the movie he is perfect) it's really funny but also in some scenes very sad and relatable. I recommend watching this movie because of :
1. Humour the ending really caught me off guard ngl üòÇ
2. The movie not being dragged out and hard to watch
3. Interesting storyline even tho there are still those smarts that think it's basic. It's not. It made me realise some sadder things about characters like Ken and think about the human world
4. Message you gotta watch the movie for this one üòè
5. Great acting, dancing and yesss even singing its a bit basic and cheesy to put this to the list but I find it really impressive on how natural a human can act like a barbie.",1
"Barbie movie is a comedy which is based on absurd plot twists and things which happen throughout the film. It offers many laughs and has a lot of hidden jokes which add up to a great movie. I was worried there would be much too many musical scenes, but after watching it I believe they were put there with good reason and in just the right places. The whole scene nearing the end of the film (I won't spoil anyhting, don't worry) was just so well done, I loved that the play on women-male dynamics was very lighthearted, but just serious enough. There is apsolutely no men-bashing.",1
I get the point but nah man! 7.5!!??,0
"You'll never going to hate this movie, as soon as possible!!",1
"I was be able to attend the pre premiere of this movie and I have to say this movie was unexpectetly good and this comes from a non Barbie fan. Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.",1
"Those three stars are for the visuals and production design. The movie is just unbearable and exhausting. It's a very undermining and a pointless movie. Thank God the runtime is short. I'm still trying to figure out who actually are the target audience for this. It's neither for kids nor for teens nor for women nor for men. I don't understand the point for making this movie. It begins very well, but tumbles down from there. Real-world seems more cartoonish than the Barbie world. That could be the real reason for Barbie to come out of Barbie-world and turn into a human. Relatability to any character is zero.",0
"OMG, how bad is this? 3/10 is a good rating for a movie like this one compared to a GOOD MOVIE!",0
"Consistently entertaining, imaginative, and occasionally wickedly funny, Greta Gerwig helms an audaciously original take on the iconic doll, fashioning a pastel wonderland with deeper, albeit crudely pushed, morals and ideas. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, the stereotypical perfect doll whose carefree existence in the utopian Barbieland is one day disrupted, leading her eventually into the real world, accompanied by the hapless Ken, played by Ryan Gosling in a valiant attempt to drag character from caricature.",1
"I was literally praying to be struck dead so I didn't have to see one more second of this film. Even Margot Robbie couldn't save this over hyped trash. I could feel my IQ drop each minute of the movie that went by. I was amazed, shocked and in horror to see that there were actually people on IMDB none the less who thought this film was ::gasp:: good? Not even close, waste of my time and a waste of my life which I can never get back.",0
"Barbie was a great film. This movie is so well written and super clever. Makes you laugh, cry, and ponder what it means to live in today's world.",1
"The 1968 picture Planet of the Apes reverses traditional roles. After time-travelling thousands of years into the future, astronaut Charlton Heston discovers a world where apes are the advanced primate, and humans their chattels.",1
"Barbie was an entertaining movie, but was definitely not worth the hype that accompanied the film. The messages the movie wanted to share were so on the nose and explicit that it became jarring and weird. The movie also meandered from place to place and didn't seem to have a purpose for the majority of its run time.",1
"Okay I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's funny, it's charming, and also manages to make you cry. It reminds me of the kind of movie that becomes a cult classic years later, like Napoleon Dynamite or Drop Dead Gorgeous. It's definitely not for everyone, but in my opinion the wacky bounce between spoof and serious makes it wildly entertaining. This isn't a movie to take seriously, but it is definitely thought provoking. It's take on feminism and the patriarchy is displayed in a way that is almost making fun of itself. And I think that's nice, because the movie displays a message that everyone should be equal, living a life in a patriarchal society isn't great, but neither is one designed for women. Like The Importance of Being Earnest, it nods to the problems of the world in a comedic way, making it easier to digest.",1
"What was Ryan Gosling thinking when he signed up for this. Every movie he has been in were great movies, but this has got to be the biggest waste and should be one of his big regrets.",0
"I just finished watching Barbie and I have to say, it was absolutely amazing! The perfect blend of humor, cuteness, and emotion really made the film stand out. The message was conveyed flawlessly and it had a big impact on me. It also brought back some great memories from my childhood. All of the details on the houses, the dialogues, and the clothes were so impressive that they really added to the overall experience. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were absolutely brilliant in their performances and Ken's act had me laughing non-stop! This movie is definitely a masterpiece. I must say, good job, Greta! I only gave it 9 out of 10 because I wish it could have been a bit longer.",1
"This movie touches on complex themes the way the Truman show and West World were able to do but in a way that was more glittery and a bit more superficial. Because it juxtaposes a world that was created in the imagination of women (Barbieland) vs. Men (the real world), it has a bit of a devastating conclusion for both: mainly that people struggle to live up to ideals, resulting in feelings of alienation and depression that they try to hide. What I appreciated so much about the movie was its commentary on men feeling like they need a ""Barbie"" at their side to feel successful. It occurred in Barbieland but honestly it was a commentary on both men and women who feel that way in both worlds. It's easier to think that someone else will help us determine why we are here instead of really exploring who we are and what our purpose is as individuals. There's a loneliness that rung so true at the heart of the Ken experience. Curious what men thought of it and if they could relate.",1
"Like many, I saw the ads and read the hype surrounding this movie. And who would walk away from the perfect summer time movie that features Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling? I mean just based on curiosty alone, what would a movie about a child's doll be about? So off to the movies we went. And after the first 2 minutes, I was already having a bad feeling about this one.....and I really wanted to like it. As expected, much of the movie happens in BarbieLand, a perfect little beach front community where everyone cherishes Barbie. Lots of singing and dancing, colorful scenery, character introductions and so forth. You wonder where the story is going and out of the blue comes the theme of death. So at this point, its no longer a kids movie IMO. And the story developes into Barbie's mission to cross in to the real world to save the person who's not happy with their Barbie doll. And by not happy, I mean depressed with thoughts of death. A pretty dark twist. So the mission begins with Ken and Barbie visiting LA. The story becomes a mix of several themes including female enpowerment, corporate greed and a push for a male dominated society. Although I chuckled a couple times, this movie never sucked me into the story to the point where I felt I wasnt in a theater, if you know what I mean. In fact, it felt like every 15 minutes I was hoping the movie was over. Margot and Ryan give outstanding performances, but the novelty of Barbieland quickly wears off, leaving the audience blasted with bubblegum pop music and watching Barbie disolve into an emotional trainwreck as she faces a personal identity chrisis. Of course, this becomes the stories message to tweens, that life's hard, its OK to fail and finding strength to succeed isnt easy, regardless of gender. Its an awkward movie in that it doesnt really fit for kids or adults, unless you ignore the story and just look at the pictures.",1
"There's a bold and consistent current of subversive humanism that runs through this infectious 2023 satire that director Greta Gerwig manages with stylish aplomb. She and partner Noah Baumbach have taken the Barbie mythos and built a multilayered narrative around the evolving nature of female identity and empowerment within the context of male dominance and the patriarchy that has defined sexual roles since the beginning of time. However, this is neither a treatise nor a polemic. It's still primarily a fun, free-wheeling farce with Day-Glo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective. Margot Robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives Ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity. The rest of the cast appear equally game. Gerwig has truly applied a perceptive twist to a candy-coated girlhood memory.",1
"Overall, this movie was about what I expected. It was a fun, summer blockbuster packed with stars and it felt like a nice, fresh break from all the superhero movies and rehashed stories that have been pushed out lately. It's not perfect, and I feel the messaging at times was too blunt, but the elements of the movie that were silly and enjoyable balanced it out",1
"But damnit, it was GREAT. The opening scene was good, then the first scene in Barbieland worried me. Not worried me like it would be bad, but that I would be right: that it would be good by virtue of being so over the top. And it was that too. But it's a surprisingly serious movie. In theme, not execution. But it says a lot of quiet parts out loud. What we did with our Barbies. To them. Who is Ken anyway? Why is Ken? What is death and why does it matter? What is motivation and what is success? What is feminism and what is dementia t progress? Honestly. I would have thought you were blowing my horn. And that sounds fun for a Friday night, but this is worth it. And a good movie to brave the theater for. The link was weird but vibrant and balanced in a way the big screen really lit up.",1
"It boggles the mind how anyone could be offended at a fun film like Barbie. Honestly, it says more about the offended than it. Does anything else.",1
"Alas, my high hopes were crushed. When i heard about this project, I saw the opportunity, and expected, rather hoped for, an utterly ridiculous over the top comedy where dollified actors could come up with some novel situations. I wanted to see what kind of comedic chops Gosling would trot out. Instead, after a razzmatazz showbiz intro, dancing dolls and high energy, the sad, busy, and quizzical plot unfolds as a very sorry melodrama. An emotionally vulnerable and beautiful but pitiful Barbie, and a truly oafish Ken, have passed through a ""Dimensional Membrane"" onto the earth plane, into a reality just as bizarre and unrealistic as the Barbie-Dimension, and the two doll-humanoids find themselves maladaptive and disliked, even persecuted. And they have come looking for a solution to an unpleasant sort of problem. This just isn't funny. It's pretty much a reworking of Judy Garland in OZ, way out of her element, trying to find the Ruby Slippers. In fact, it was a deformation of her feet as a Doll in Barbieland, that kicks off this whole sorry setup. Now I have to ask myself why I was expecting a comedy? Well, because the advertising suggested something ludicrous. When you see Will Ferrell doing pratfalls and the entire surreal pink Landscape of Barbie Land, Gosling with idiotic facial expressions and gestures, and Barbie presented as a very sexualized Super-Bimbo, sort of a witless Mae West, (who was very witty), I thought some very funny stuff was coming down the pike. Nope. I wouldn't say avoid it, but I would say it never really finds it's tone, and doesn't live up to its advertised premise. The crowd around me wanted to laugh, that was clear, and was struggling to find something funny in things that just weren't. This must have cost a fortune to produce. The money could have been better spent.",0
They really did some fantastic marketing with this movie.,1
"Honestly I loved it. The colors were brilliant. The usage of popular artists and actors as really well done. All of the characters were brilliantly casted. The it was intriguing, and generally attriactive for both young and mature audiences. I think because of this though, it just didn't hit as hard for me. The messages within the movie were quite profound, and many of my friends ended up emotional due to its relatability and the fact that nothing actually changed at the end. Good overall, stellar for younger audiences, and would 100% recommend to a younger child. Not my color palette, so it was a bit bright. Not riveting. Just good.",1
"I did not have incredibly high expectations for the lengths that some may have felt this film will go into, maybe because of it being sided with Nolan's Oppenheimer, but you should maybe your readjust your expectations a bit before going into this to enjoy the full experience. What I mean is that there are hints of the graceful indie style of directing Gerwig presented in her previous works, but it is mostly set up as a blockbuster comedy, but one that is still really enjoyable.",1
"You know that saying, ""show, don't tell""?",0
"I was excited to see what this movie would delve into, and it being from a woman's point of view sounded promising. I was expecting a fun, slightly superfluous film, but safe to say, it was so much more than that.",1
OMG IT IS SO GOOD especially for young woman! It is so inspiring and really shows everything Barbie is. I think this movie is good for all ages because it will teach all woman how life really is and it will teach young girls the reailty of this world and how to prepare for obstacles that come there way. This movie was funny as well as informing and I didn't expect this plot at all from this movie. I would see this again becuase it is just that good and I think out would needs to turn to Barbie land because there world is fair and I wish we could be like that. It is so amazing so so so good 5/5.,1
"The Barbie motion picture is one of the most captivating and thought-provoking productions of this year. When I watched the movie, not only did I witness an entertaining story, but I also appreciated the attention paid to important social issues such as feminism, women's rights and gender equality.",1
"For a girl who grew up playing with Barbies wasn't at all what I thought it would be. I didn't think there would be a huge plot, and I was so wrong! The movie should be what every woman needs to see. Everyone in it was amazing and perfect (not Barbie perfect üòâ). Had an amazing plot that made me really consider how far women have not come in life. I do love the line when a man has to ask for a job in the government and gets told he can have a much lesser job. I can not give it enough accolades. Everyone cast was perfect for their role. America Ferrera and Margot Robbie were perfection for each role!!!!",1
This movie was so emotionally moving in a way that I didn't expect at all. I loved how critically it evolves around the Barbie and Ken figure and questions everything you ever took for granted in a very nice and intelligent way. I absolutely loved this movie and would watch it again any time.,1
"Rating: 8.1
Overall, a feminist powerhouse of a movie as Greta Gerwig exceeded my expectations to create a very fun movie to watch as it is filled with an enjoyable cast, funny jokes, and memorable production design, costumes, and soundtrack as the movie tells many different messages about self-image and societal power, even though it is very on-the-nose about it and does not tie up all the loose ends.",1
"In Greta's ""Barbie,"" the iconic doll takes on real-world problems in this comedy-meets-existential film, transforming from a seemingly superficial figure to a multi-dimensional character. Through physical and emotional challenges, Barbie discovers the true strength that comes from within, while the movie skillfully balances humor with deeper existential questions. As her journey unfolds, Barbie's exploration of empathy and self-discovery resonates profoundly with audiences, reminding them of the significance of creative freedom in cinema. The film's portrayal of Barbie's evolution from a controversial symbol to a beacon of empowerment becomes a captivating exploration of womanhood and the enduring spirit of femininity.",1
"I was never into Barbie as a child because I thought she's just a boring toy. The operative word being - toy. So when the controversy started about her impossibly small waist, sky high beauty standards, white skin and blonde hair, I thought some people just have too much time on their hands or because they're just jealous at someone else's success. It's easier to blast someone else's hard work rather than strike it out on your own and keep doing it.",0
I went into this movie because of the hype it brought towards the cinema culture and the internet thing. Suprisingly i was hooked and even some mililitres of tears might have formed in my eyes at the end.,1
"I was looking forward to watch this movie and now I am severely disappointed. The first ten minutes was the best part, and I took me to the days where I had my dolls.",0
"With Barbie, we embark on a journey that feels oddly reminiscent of the ""Legally Blonde"" series. While the movie is fun and aims to champion the empowerment of women, it somewhat stumbles on the path of originality.",1
"Greta Gerwig should be proud of herself and so should everyone involved in the making of Barbie because it was such a great film . I watched Barbie on the first day it came out and the cinema was packed, when it got to the scene where the Mum was telling the Barbie's what it's really like to be a woman the audience were clapping because they agreed and it creates such a lovely atmosphere that I've never been in or felt at the cinema . Many people who haven't watched the movie seem to have a problem with it because they think it's just about feminism when it's now because when the Barbie's eventually got there power back they didn't create a matriarchy like the Ken's creating a patriarchy but they found a way to live as close to equally as they could. Overall, Barbie is a great film and you should watch it no matter what anybody says because you will feel changed in a sort of way that you can't put into words after seeing it.",1
"When I first heard about this movie, I didn't want to see it. Then I watched the trailer and my mind was changed instantly. Margot Robbie as Barbie could not have been a better casting choice, Ryan Gosling as Ken was just *chef's kiss*. It's a wonderfully beautiful and talented cast. It's charming, funny, touching, powerful and overall perfect. The soundtrack is fantastic, I've been listening to I'm Just Ken on repeat for days now. The diversity and representation within the cast is beautiful and so exciting to see in a movie as big as this one. Greta Gerwig and everyone who worked on this movie absolutely knocked it out of the park.",1
"I loved to watch the movie, it had all elements one would have want to have seen. The journey of barbie to the real world was something I was really looking forward it and I am quite satisfied with it completely , the movie had lovely humour and I was completely mesmerized by Ryan's character it gave a very balanced effect to the movie, there could be a point where the movie felt very overwhelming due to a lot of factors but it was quite a journey to look forward to, the audience was very pleased around me and everyone had a lot of fun watch it. It seems like a fun movie with a very deep meaning behind, the ending was very unexpected and gave a twist very similar to the truman show.",1
"This movie is amazing. It perfectly describes womanhood in a way few movies that I've seen has. It shows how different women and men are treated and also the feeling of growing up as a woman. I started to miss all my childhood Barbies that we gave to my little cousin now. It's also completely hilarious and the cast is absolutely perfect. Almost No one else could play Barbie and Ken as good as Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling has. Even though it's technically about Barbie's DOSENT MEAN that it's aimed for children. It's perfect for women of all ages, and for men to learn more about what it's like to simply grow up and simply exist as a woman.",1
Barbie lives in a perfect world.,1
This movie is charming and many people I know who also watched this absolutely loved it and recommended it to me. The movie was hilarious and we all had a laugh. Everybody enjoyed this and actually had fun. At the end of the movie I was left with wanting more. This movie is at least in the top 5 as it was something I didn't expect to enjoy. I thought at first that it would just another mediocre movie but I was so wrong. Somehow everything about this movie put together worked so well. Ryan Gosling as Ken and Margot Robbie as Barbie both casts did a fantastic job. I would absolutely rewatch this as it was better than I expected. I highly recommend this. This Barbie movie got everybody wearing pink and it just did everything right. Honestly hats off to all casts & crew. I LOVED THIS!!!,1
"What distinguishes this film from many other blockbusters is the fact that the film is an original film. Greta Gerwig is mastermind behind this idea. Although the film is completely different from her other works with its ""doll-like"" performance of the main characters, too bright colors and a certain surrealism, her message is still visible, especially in the story. The film can also be called a coming-of-age story, which in many ways is what her previous works are. After all, at the beginning of the story, Barbie is a child, but simply in the body of an adult woman, and at the end she is already a real adult. Greta Gerwig is a true genius who was able to tell the story of a children's doll, but in an adult way and with reflections and death, freedom, justice and much more. And besides, she did it incredibly beautifully and with excellent musical accompaniment, which is typical of her works.",1
"I watched this movie in the theater 9 weeks after its release. When the crowd of the Barbenheimer made its exit safely, it was time for me to move in, not dressed in pink -none of the 6 of us in the audience was- and watch it away from the hype.",1
"This movie is a feminist fever dream that teaches young girls that they will never be successful in the world as long as men exist, and that men are horrible, ironically Ken played by Ryan Gosling is the best part of this movie, bringing more laughs than anything else.",0
"This movie gives me a great vibe, you should also watch it because you would like it as much as I do. It's beautiful, cute and very funny, I love watching movies like this with my girlfriends because they are very entertaining and beautiful. I can't wait to watch it together because I've never watched this movie, I hope I really like your movie app. I'm going to be delighted because after this picture I'm already hoping that it's really fun to watch! Your app is so good that it's better than Netflix. It's going to be great, I can't wait to eat chips and laugh with my friends it's going to be great tonight, watch us at Barbieeee.",1
"I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.",1
"I was super excited to see this movie but I'm coming away from the cinema a bit disappointed. The marketing for this was amazing and everyone who watched it said that its not going to be what I expect and so my expectations were very high. There were some clever jokes and very beautiful sets and costumes but honestly the plot was hard to follow and there was nothing very nuanced or clever about the message. I think this film is a little late, maybe it would have resonated better a few years ago when these conversations were first taking place but to me it doesn't add much value to the feminist cause. It's worth seeing as it's definitely of cultural interest, but I won't be rewatching it.",1
"I'm not one of those people who feel the need to apologize for watching 'Barbie'. In my opinion there are no bad movie genres, there are only good movies and bad movies. And the cinema is also popular entertainment, and buying a big bowl of popcorn and sitting in the air-conditioned theater to watch a musical comedy that features some of the most talented actors of the moment can't be the worst thing on a hot summer day. 'Barbie', Greta Gerwig's film did not make me regret the decision to watch it for at least three quarters of its duration.",1
"You don't know what to expect before watching Barbie, and I can assure you it met my expectations and exceeded them!",1
This is an odd movie. On the one hand the presentation of the Barbie world... and Mattel making fun of itself... is fantastic.,1
"This movie was so much lively and joyful. Also filled a lot of pink
It was so amazing. It's like dream world",1
"Yes its a Barbie which means it will be on par with the animated movies (having a lead character and the story revolving around her), but when I put it on my, the acquired humor caught me unexpectedly and the movie had a few high points and it somehow, for god knows what reasons, kept my interest.",1
"This might just be the best movie I've ever seen. The more I think about it, the more I realize just how genius it is! I mean they really thought out every little detail!",1
"Barbie is definitely one of the best films to bought out to cinemas this year, or even longer than that. It had us laughing from the start to finish, crying in some moments and scenes so overall it was an emotional rollercoaster. Greta has done a great job and balanced a mix of fun and hard truths about the world we live in today. For people say this isn't worth watching, clearly don't know how to let a film just transport you away into its world for a moment, absolutely brilliant film, I'd pay to go and watch it again. Well done to Greta, Margot, Ryan and all of the cast & crew for a fantastic watch!",1
"I was hesitant when I put it on but WOW! I never imagined it'd be as good as it is! The acting was on point, beautiful sets, and an amazing storyline & plot! üëè when I first attempted to watch it, I thought it wouldn't be worth much so I was doing other things, caught myself several times stopping to watch until I finally paused it, finished what I was doing and sat down to watch it from the beginning and I'm so glad I did. I've already recommended it to my friends. Glad I was able to take advantage of Amazon having it to purchase as I hate movie theaters. So it worked out well being as I can now watch it whenever I like. Which I'm sure will be often.",1
Honestly this is the weirdest movie I have ever seen. It is definitely a good movie but I'm not sure what to make of it. The message was so convoluted that you didn't know what it was trying to say.,1
"So, I didn't have that much of a high expectation going in to see this because I really wasn't sure what is was going to be. I grew up playing Barbie's and have watched the animated films many times with my kids.",1
"I wasn't expecting much, after all, it is a movie about a doll - however, I was pleasantly surprised that it managed to develop a story that it was relevant and had a strong emotional core.",1
"Barbie will be a pioneer and a classic in the film world. She shatters all expectations and supersedes all standards. She is incredibly insightful, touching, truthful, whimsical. Barbie is made by women for women. To any man who ""doesn't get it"", you wont, but I invite you to watch it anyways as a show of support to women and our lived experiences and our dreams and hopes.",1
"The beauty in the movie isn't merely skin deep. The story woven throughout Barbie is a true testament to the power of belief in oneself and the importance of friendship and teamwork. Barbie's determination and courage in the face of challenges inspire viewers to embrace their own strengths and strive for greatness. The characters in Barbie are wonderfully developed, each with their own unique personalities that add depth and charm to the narrative. Barbie herself, with her resilience and strong sense of justice, is a shining example of a positive role model.",1
The movie that breaks all norms and once again proves that following the norm does not get you anywhere. The emotional roller coaster with a colourful palette is an absolute masterpiece of story telling with strong social messaging. The songs touch the right emotions and at times; the audience were visibly tearful. Barbie represents every one of us . All the characters shine through and the actor and the story is bold. Mattel have proved to be visionary in being bold and addressing the shortcomings of their marketing . This takes a lot of guts. The movie absolutely hammers home the point - representation matters. And there is a Barbie in each one of us.,1
"The movie is mediocre at best. I expected an original funny thought provoking film, I got a funny run of the mill movie. I think had I come in with lower expectations it could have been better. Not saying the movie is bad, but throughout the movie it felt like I was listening to music without the bass. I know it's weird but that's literally how it felt. The social commentary was good, but felt a little forced sometimes. I expected the movie to be another Lego Movie where the tules are completely altered, however, you'll find that it follows the same plot arch as well as direction as any other movie, but with a flair of barbie. The visuals could have been incredible based on the world they are in, and in some scenes they were really hood, but most of it is just like any other movie but with beautiful colourful sets. Overall it was really disappointing.",0
"I am amazed at the enormous success of this film. I'm not implying that it is a bad movie, but it's just a fun film based on dolls. It certainly is different and kind of unique with a pretty wonderful opening along with a fascinating production design, but ya gotta love pink! It's all about feminism and patriarchy and it's a little heavy handed about both of those topics, but it makes its points. While it's not a great film, it took some great talent to make this odd idea work and I am referring specifically to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach who provide some funny and witty moments. In my opinion, both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both too old for their roles, but they pull it off quite well. While it looks and feels like a children's film some of the time since this is about dolls, it's message is for adults, though children would appreciate a lot of it without really getting it, so to speak. It also has some really good choreography and a very nice song by Billie Eilish who I am kind of surprised doesn't appear in this at some point, though Will Ferrell does, which is a shame as he is his usual annoying self, but that's just me. I've never understood his appeal.",1

"Written by Ian Chandler - July 21, 2023",1
"Grandiose movie: colourful, lovingly staged, entertaining, definitely strange but never trashy. The actors are brilliant, the dialogue to the point and the set design fantastic. It had everything: I laughed, I was thoughtful, I cried. My husband was also thrilled. Great cinema has been achieved here, from which everyone can certainly take something away, whether they are Barbie fans or not. I was excited to see the film because of the director and for me Greta Gerwig's masterful skills have been confirmed. Thank you for 114 minutes of escapism without ever losing sight of reality. For me, the best film so far in 2023.",1
I enjoyed the movie a lot with many jokes and sarcasm the characters keep throwing.,1
"The movie did something that has never been done before. The details, the music, comedy, and my favourite.... the outifts!!! I could have never imagined that a movie with such entertaining characters and plot could be made based on a Barbie. I truly reccomend you warching this film, not only it is entertaining, but it reminds you how great it is to be independed and how to stay true to yourself. The movie also highlits the importance of talking about your emotions and how holding them im might lead to something worse.",1
"Even though she is only a doll, she does not have to be an airhead. Here in lies ""Lady Bird"" filmmaker Greta Gerwig's creative, modern-day approach to bringing one of America's most recognizable toys to life on screen. When you add that to the decision to cast Margot Robbie in the lead role, ""Barbie"" is off to the right, flawlessly arched start.",1
"I am so torn, on this movie. There is no doubt, that Barbie is beautifully made movie, with an awesome cast and an amazing creative team. Margo Robbie was born to play Barbie and lets be honest Ryan Gosling stole the entire movie. Then again I can't think of a single cast Member I didn't like. The references are amazing, as a boy with a sister, I grew with Barbie so I recognised a lot things. But, I did not care for the writing and some of the movies messages, were not just bad, but problematic. I was going to go into details about all the things that bothered me, but I'm not spoiling anything. I don't hate this movie, by any means, but I don't love it either. I think the target audience will love it, and lets be honest thats not me.",1
"I absolutely loved it. Margot Robbie is the perfect stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives an Oscar-worthy performance and has a true rock 'n' roll voice. The soundtrack is also very, very good. Subjects of patriarchy and cultural hegemony are approached with humour and historical references. Michael Cera is funnily adorable. Barbie is funny and surprisingly entertaining. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote an enchanting script with genuine emotion. Barbie was brilliantly cast. I loved Ryan Gosling. He's terrific as Ken and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. The ending is good and it's worth sticking around to watch the credits.",1
"Yikes if this movie offends you! üòÇ I loved all the characters, the instructions and montages of how to get to the real world, the mom/daughter storyline, the depression ad lol, weird barbie, the horses, the physical comedy (showering, going down a slide), and great use of a really good Matchbox 20 song. üòÇüòÇ Margot and Ryan are such standouts in this and the costumes are amazing. This movie is an instant classic! Such iconic moments and ideas. It is perfectly placed in 2023 and will be talked about for ages. Congrats to Greta and her team for achieving such an amazing box office opening weekend.",1
"I was pretty excited to see this film and hope I'm not going to get put on a list for saying I didn't enjoy it that much. The message of female empowerment was fine, but didn't really speak to gender equality. Barbieland is the opposite of real world where Barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. However, the ending just puts Barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which I hope is our goal. The movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. You could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup. Good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense. I think this was a made for tik tok movie where there's 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together.",1
In this film I loved I really like costumes and I really the main them on the film it was very good I thought that film will be for kids and children but it literally isn't it is for adults more than a child Margot Robbie is the perfect actress for the main Barbie but main ken could be a different actor Ryan gosling is ver handsome but he is too old for the main ken role I love the main message of the movie I love Emma in education series but she showed us she can be play in other type of roles and I like the pink theme it's very sweet and cute and last thank you all persons who worked in this film.,1
"Barbenheimer? Who is the winner? Actually, when I thought about it, their are two completely different movies. Both of them are great, I will tell you why this movie is great, but the main point is that you can't just compare this two movies. Anyway, Greta Gerwig did an absolutely amazing job, and I was so surprised over how deep and emotional this movie really was. This is not made for kids, even if you could think this would be for kids, but no. Some sexual humor and a very complex moral that not every child would understand. The good things about Barbie is the valuable moral itself. They show you that the world and humanity, isn't perfect, and it is never going to be perfect, you just have to focus on how you are now. They showed how women were treated in centuries, and the big pressure on men and how they have to be in front of women, strong, reckless and to never show their feelings. That is something I wouldn't expect from this movie, I was very surprised, and the representation of men, Ken (Just Ken) as the main Ken played be Ryan Gosling, he did just an amazing job at showing how men are and their behaviour. Margot Robbie was the second big star, or the first, both of them were amazing, but she played with such a feeling and emotion. When Barbie, the main Barbie played by Margot, discovered that the world and the people in the world are not perfect, and that not everyone are like her, she was completely off. Margot Robbie showed that feeling in the exactly good way as it should be showed in. Besides the actors, the storytelling, scenography and music soundtrack was amazing. Sometimes it was a bit too much screaming, but that's not the point, this movie was awesome! This is a movie for everyone. If you like Barbie, this movie is for you, if you don't like Barbie, this movie is for you. This is a movie made for everyone, everyone can enjoy it, and I can't really understand why so many countries made this movie forbidden. This movie offers you so much moral, entertainment, and I think this was a great movie.",1
"The movie is entertaining, funny and it does touches on more serious topics, there is times that it feels that those topics are too on the face and can ruin the passing but is rarely noticeable.",1
"Barbie is a modern fantasy with lots of metaphors about existentialism & feminism, and how everybody (men & women) should get equal opportunity. The archetypal Barbie & Ken have fulfilling story arcs. As do the main human characters when Barbie World and the Real World collide. That collision is a big part of making this a fantasy.",1
I am clearly not the target audience for this one but I still enjoyed it.,1
"I loved how they translated the Barbieland from our imaginations tp screen. The clothes, colours and stages are beautifully done.",1
"This movie was not what I expected at first, but I loved it. It's been years since I watched a new big budget movie that was so bright and fun with its own sense of logic. Taika Waititi said in an interview that Hollywood (particularly superhero) movies have gotten so dark and when he was a kid he went to the cinema to escape the darkness of life. I feel like Barbie could be the start of the un-darkening of Hollywood movies.",1
"Ignore all of the salty toxic masculinity comments, this movie was perfect.",1
"This movie LOOKED amazing. The costumes, sets, editing, and choreography were all high-budget and high-quality. That's probably why the poor writing stuck out like a sore thumb.",0
"Went to the Wednesday Barbie Blow Out showing - I went into it thinking it was going to be a cute charming movie. It wasn't anything I expected, I've never seen a movie like this before, on all levels from writing, the sets. Every actor has such amazing range. The way each scene transformed your mind set, having you want more. This movie was so good It was written with current, real issues while also being nostalgic and filled with Easter eggs, while giving ode to the past and so self aware. The writers and actors perfectly put into a scene the struggles, heartache, dissonance into everyday life, while making you cry of both laughter and sadness.",1
"I didn't see Barbie in the theater (but I don't see many in the theater anymore) but I had seen glowing reviews as well as friends who had seen the film and recommended. By the time I was able to view the film I had high expectations. There were certainly extremely funny moments, but for me few and far between. Gosling was singled out by many as the best in the film and I agreed there were enough outlandish moments with his character that earned him that. But, I thought that Michael Cera's character Allan was far funnier, even though his role was more of an extended cameo. I can't deny that Margot Robbie was an exceptional Barbie but overall I was disappointed with the film. Gerwig went a bit too far with her support of women's rights (which I do support). It may have been the build up prior to seeing the movie that actually resulted in it not reaching my expectations. I've had that same issue with other films, however.",1
"It strikes generational emotional strings, the grace and charm reflected in honing in a clean performance. Delight to watch, and it will make you laugh and cry.",1
This movie was a big hype not only in the internet but also in the local radio and tv. This was a good reason to watch this movie. It was watched in a open place cinema. The audience flooded it more than its limit with a rate of 70/30 of females vs males.,1
"Greta Garwig is a pretty interesting filmmaker as her previous works on ""Lady Bird"" and ""Little Women"" were pretty good. Here, ""Barbie"" is really wild but I had a really fun time watching it. Throughout, the colorful pink designs, models, background, settings and structures were pretty good as it helps add the film's purposeful tone and atmosphere all together. Written by Noah Baumbach, the narrative is pretty good as it's clear the film doesn't take itself seriously and explores some pretty interesting satirical themes that worked well together with the story. All the performances were pretty good especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as they have pretty great chemistry with one another. The characters were really fun to watch as it was fun to see all the Barbies, Kens, Allen, and the real world characters interact and perform on the screen.",1
"I expected a funny, easy-going movie that you can watch while scrolling on your phone. I was amazed by the depth of the story. Feminism done right, without the overly woke culture that is cringey and contraproductive in most cases. A must see if you're capable of seeing beyond the pitch perfect pink world. :) Wasn't sure about Ryan Gosling as Ken, the match seemed off, but after seeing the movie I think he did great. Helen Mirren is the narrator which is also amazing. Beautiful story abour equality, feminism, finding your role in the world and also about the importance of finding yourself in the big world.",1
"My wife dragged me to see this, after I took her to see Indiana Jones. I'm not going to jump on this band wagon, this was a silly movie. I know what you are thinking ""typical male"", but no, I was willing to see this and put a high rating, if necessary.",0
"Being a boy growing up I was never a ""Barbie"" doll collector, always had mostly ""Star Wars"", ""WWF"", and ""He Man"" figures, yet I like all others knew the impact and cultural historical vibe of the Mattel toy line. This film from director Greta Gerwig which blends the toy and real worlds together, so well showing what it's like to deal with being accepted into reality with people who have loved you as a toy doll. The movie rightfully called ""Barbie"" is a fun one a real sentimental journey a film really of escape, fantasy, a touching adventure that's blended with comedy and drama. The acting and on screen chemistry is in top notch form with ""Barbie""(the beautiful and sexy attractive Margot Robbie) and ""Ken""(Ryan Gosling) as they live in the colorful and magical playland life it all seems just a dream, only when signs of malfunction and a hint that ""Barbie"" might be human the film changes. As going into the real world to search for the cure to become a toy again offers plenty of moments that have you as a viewer laughing and feeling emotions as you really along, with the central character feel the compare and contrast and weigh the choices and decisions that humans must make, and the real world even sees the ""Barbie"" toys in a different light. Overall well done good feel good entertaining film as the sets and displays of pink give escape and fun, even if you were not a ""Barbie"" collector you will enjoy this film as it provides the messages of love and acceptance.",1
"A good laugh of a film poking fun at Mattel, complicating the concept of Barbie while at the same time highligting the patriarchy and it's inherent incompatibility with human emancipation.",1
"Barbie is a fun little movie that is, at its core, a satire on traditional gender roles in society. Thrown in is some mild commentary on materialism and how reality seldom (if ever) lives up to our youthful expectations. Some people have claimed the movie posits a subversive anti-male agenda but I can't see it that way. It's simply a movie, based on a toy, that dares to actually not take itself seriously. Look at other films in this genre such as Battleship, GI Joe and the Transformers films. All take ludicrous concepts and imbue them with a ridiculous amount of dark ""realism"". Barbie doesn't do that. It reveals that it's a joke in the very first scene.",1
"I took my twin daughters to go see this film at the movie theaters with me this weekend. They are 11 and they seemed to enjoy it. The film is geared much to a older crowd, which helped keep them entertained as well as the adults that were in the theater as well. Margot Robbie was great as Barbie she did very good in that role. I love how the film put a modern twist on how people are these days in society- dealing with social anxiety and other disorders. Yet it tells the story of why Barbie was initially invented to began with and what Barbie and Ken stood for. This is a good film to watch with your teenage daughters.",1
I took my whole family to this movie thinking it was something we all could enjoy at least a little. My two girls are 6 and 8... I realized going in that it's mostly for adults but I wasn't expecting it to be totally for adults given the theme. Too bad. My oldest daughter was so disappointed by it that she was crying after and didn't understand it to be honest - she thought it was going to be more fun because we watched the trailers over and over. I mean it was a fantastic production and a lot of creativity went into making the Barbie world but why did they have to make the Barbie characters so introspective. So much crying and melodramatic parts for a movie that should be geared towards a kids imagination. And why did the ending need to be so lame. I thought at the very list they could have ended it on a fun note for the kids but the ending really sucked for my daughters.,1
"Honestly it's Ryan Gosling that made this movie for me and no not just the holy cow hot body! He's got such a great sense of humour so funny, him and Simu Liu just bounced off each other so well. It's a cute little fun movie if you just want a good laugh. Im still trying to understand Will Ferrells character though, it was very lame and I know he's supposed to be the antagonist but it really did not work for me.",1
"If it were possible to rate this movie a negative 10 I would. Twenty five minutes in, and I was ready to walk out of the theater. It was without a doubt one of the silliest, most stupid movies I have ever seen in my life. It finally got a little better 30 minutes in, which brought it up to a negative three. Want an extreme waste of the talents of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. How did anyone ever convince them to star in this pink train wreck of a movie? Newsflash to Margo and Ryan, you're only as popular as your last movie! Lots of careers have gone into the toilet after a lousy movie like this one!",0
"Doesn't seem to matter what I do I'm always number two No one knows how hard I tried, oh-oh, I I have feelings that I can't explain Drivin' me insane All my life, been so polite But I'll sleep alone tonight 'Cause I'm just Ken Anywhere else, I'd be a ten Is it my destiny to live and die a life of blond fragility? I'm just Ken Where I see love, she sees a friend What will it take for her to see the man behind the tan and fight for me? I wanna know what it's like to love To be the real thing Is it a crime? Am I not hot when I'm in my feelings? And is my moment finally here, or am I dreaming? I'm no dreamer Can you feel the Ken-ergy? Feels so real, my Ken-ergy Can you feel the Ken-ergy? Feels so real, my Ken-ergy I'm just Ken Anywhere else, I'd be a ten Is it my destiny to live and die a life of blond fragility? I'm just Ken
Where I see love, she sees a friend What will it take for her to see the man behind the tan and fight for me? I'm just Ken (And I'm enough)
And I'm great at doing stuff So, hey, check me out, yeah, I'm just Ken My name's Ken (And so am I) Put that manly hand in mine So, hey, world, check me out, yeah, I'm just Ken Baby, I'm just Ken (Nobody else, nobody else)",1
Greta gerwig does better to feminism than judith butler with this brilliant piece.,1
"This movie is made for adults, not suitable for children. Despite its marketing campaign that could easily be mistaken for a fun, kid-friendly film, it is riddled throughout with adult language, sexuality, and mature themes. It's a surprisingly unrelenting work of misandry, toxic relationships, and alternative lifestyles coated in the pink plastic shell of a beloved toy. At times it's hard to determine whether the message of the film is more about depression, disappointment, or death as the reality of the human condition. It's a clumsy attempt to paint people groups with a broad brush in order to win sympathy points for the main characters.",0
"The production and the costume design is absolutely wonderful, same goes to the most of the cast. With beautiful attention to detial, uncluding actual cars and houses that we played with.",0
"Barbie is exactly the movie the trailers promised. Different from what you expect from a toy adaptation but not fully up to the talents of the writers and director involved. An existential comedy for little girls and adults is the best way it can be described. It's very well made with the use of extensive sets and amazing actors in it. Entertaining throughout the movie even if it is mostly predictable. Great message even if it gets preachy a little bit, which surely is going to invite a lot of hate towards it too. It also shows different sides of the kind of issues in our world by juxtaposition. The self-awareness works to a point too. But the constant and blatant toy promotion kind of makes the whole thing almost pointless. I mean, I get it that Mattel only made this so they can sell their toys and was ready for the film to criticise them for the same but do they really have to overcompensate for that like this?",1
"To me, Barbie was a wonderful exploration of feminity and womanhood while also encompassing themes of patriarchy and the entitlement of men. I wasn't really sure what to expect beforehand but i was truly enjoying it and smiling nearly the whole time. It pains me, how all women and girls will be able to relate to some of the scenes and it angers me so much how men seeing this movie just hate it for the sake of hating something pink and fun.",1
"This is the best movie I've seen in last 5 years. It's fun from beginning till the end. It is just what you would expect from a barbie movie, but it's also so much more. The plot is excellent, there is a lot of cool cameos and there is a new surprise in every second of the movie. It's unpredictable, so funny and it's also kind of deep. Would recommend 10/10.",1
"I Understand that Some People are Going to Have Big Big Problems with Some of the Messaging within this Film. But Sometimes, in Life üòÇ, You Just Have to Go With It.",1
"This movie deserves all the praise and the awards it'll surely win! I couldn't stop laughing. It's full of smart jokes, touching moments, and has one of the best sets I've ever seen in a film. Highly highly recommend. It has a wonderful message for both men and women. I hope the success of this movie leads to more films directed by, starring, and made for women. Hollywood has spent far too long catering to men, I see a cultural shift in the next few years. Women want good movies too, with strong, well developed, independent female characters that don't rely on men to interact with one another. Looking forward to more movies like Barbie.",1
"What I came away with the most is surprising puzzlement, not so much for the movie's message, but for my inability to account for Margot Robbie's hold on my attention. I can't say this movie impressed me very much, and I doubt many men will enjoy it, but there is time spent with Margot Robbie, who is really unique. I can't really think of another actress who seems to understand the inner workings of a lot more than most of her peers.",1
Now please take into consideration that I am a man. And a white man at that.,1
It was a really fun and re-watchable movie. It had some really relevant messages - the only negative is that it felt the movie couldn't decide how it was going to deliver those messages. It almost felt like 2 directors were on set- 1 that wanted a whimsical movie that didn't take itself seriously and one that wanted the movie to be social commentary and they thumb wrestled at the beginning of each scene to determine who directed it.,1
A fun movie that keeps the viewer engaged with good acting and colorful scenary/costumes. The opening scene was engaging and set the tone for a funny movie. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were well cast and kept me riveted to the movie. Will Farrell should have had funnier lines and more screen time. America Ferrera and her onscreen daughter were a little yawn in the scenes. They were too depressingly real and didn't bring the lightness and humor to the movie. The dance scenes could have been cut down to edit the movie better. Overall it was a fun movie that the entire family enjoyed. Recommend for all to watch.,1
"The Barbie movie got a lot of buzz from critical praise but I was intrigued even before that because there were stories about how it had quite the journey through development. I don't know what the previous versions would have looked like but I wanted to start with how Greta Gerwig's version is structured. It would have been pretty easy to play to formula writing and developing the script, to just repackage a popular framework and insert Barbie with some different touches (paint it pink and glam it up a little). But the creative team wasn't content to do just that here, my favourite part of Barbie is the unconventional directions the plot shoots off in. Barbie coming to the real world could have been predicted but the parallel journey of Ken, Barbie bonding with Gloria and Sasha, the odyssey that the Mattel executives go on are so off-kilter and fresh. It's all firmly tongue-in-cheek as well, the movie is deliberately poking fun at both itself and the system (including the corporate owners of the Barbie brand Mattel). Is there the occasional misstep? Sure, but this movie was so rare that while I could have nitpicked and poked at inconsistencies, I didn't want to. Barbie encourages you strap in for a ride and I can forgive the occasional bump in the journey if you deliver the goods. With such a silly tone and some well-intentioned rhetoric, Barbie absolutely does that and more.",1
The start was a wonderfully fun look at Barbies & Kens in Barbieland but I felt that it was a bit abrupt when Barbie out of nowhere had thoughts of death would've made more sense for her to notice signs of imperfection first then thoughts of death.,1
"No doubt you've spent a few months hearing about Barbenheimer, referring to the simultaneous releases of Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" and Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"". Obviously the movies couldn't be more different. I saw ""Oppenheimer"" last weekend, as arms control experts had recommended seeing it before ""Barbie"" after all, she lives in the world that he helped bring about.",1
It's nice to have a movie that's fun and interesting dialogue. I knew the style of the movie by the scenes I'd seen leaked online I think that in itself is not everyone's style but boy it's unique and very barbieland. A lot of thought went into this and it's not just for women it's for anybody. We all need an Allan in our life. I could've used more boardroom ceo scenes with will farrel and his men tho. It's lovely to see the perspective of both men and women and at the end of the day what I got from this movie is about how we're each wanting to find our happiness and who we are outside of someone else.,1
"I never dreamed I'd want to see this, being an adult & all lol. It was surprisingly good. I laughed alot & it had a good message. Loved Ryan Gosling as Ken. I thought the grown women that were going to see it in the theaters dressed in pink were a little silly, but I thought I'd give it a look when it streamed. Glad I did! I wound up texting some of my girlfriends that thought it was just for kids & told them to give it a try. I got back some ""are you serious?"" texts but I said yes, give it a try. I think they will enjoy it too. It was cute & I laughed out loud several times. Ladies give it a try!",1
"As a teenager I kinda just went to this movie because of all the hype and jokes on Instagram, TikTok etc. But surprisingly this movie was actually really good. Unsurprisingly Margot Robbie was phenomenal, and was the PERFECT choice for Barbie.",1
"The whole movie is a gentle punch of love covered in perfect pink. You don't have to be perfect, you are who you are, and your existence itself shall be of intrinsic value.",1
"The movie started out fun and strong. I agree with some of the other reviews on here that the cast was excellent, set design superb, etc. However, the plot needed more clarity and to choose a better direction.",1
"Director Greta Gerwig takes us on a fun ride in the life of stereotypical Barbie ( Margot Robbie) as she navigates through various aspects of her life. She is joined by Ken ( Ryan Gosling) in this fantasy of pink decor, colourful costumes and the kitsch sets in a dream like atmosphere . The movie has exquisite cinematography ,melodious songs and attractive dances. There is an innocent quirkiness in the characters and the intermittent light humour keeps one amused. There is fun and fantasy all the way in all colourful scenes. The rainbows in the background add to the beauty. The cinematography has carefully framed fabulous visuals which will appeal to all audiences. The highlight of course is the superb acting of Margot Robbie who excells in exuding the innocent charm of the much loved character. She is definitely a refined artist who gets under the skin of the character. Ryan Gosling also does well as Ken showing his versatility. His one liners are said with his typical charm which will please his fans. The special effects help to create the dream like ambience and are pleasing to watch. I forsee the movie getting nominated for best actress ( Margot Robbie ) and for production design, costume design , make up and cinematography.",1
"Anyone expecting a light comedy about the Barbie doll and her fans based on the title will be irritated. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach unroll a crazy story around a real Barbie, in which the social roles of women and men are reflected, partly wittily, partly very seriously. I recommend the film, especially for adults, since a certain general education and life experience are required to understand the many allusions to social phenomena. I very much enjoyed the quotes from earlier film classics, such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""The Godfather"" and ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". A film worth seeing!",1
Barbie is full of pros and cons,1
"Prepare to embark on a mesmerizing journey through the enchanting world of Barbie! This handcrafted ball of serotonin is an absolute delight, leaving your heart brimming with joy from start to finish. Trust me, my cheeks were hurting too, but it was a small price to pay for the unbridled happiness that ensued.",1
"I went into this film opening day for a good laugh not expecting too much from it. When I exited the theatre I was shocked by how good of a film it was. I didn't expect it to be so funny, so we'll written, I just thought it would be okay and a bit cheesy but no. Truly a great film but there are a few jokes that might go over young kids heads, as well as some of the references. One of the most fun films of the year to experience, especially if you are depressed after watching 'Oppenheimer'. It has moments of sadness, laughs and so much more. Overall 10/10, great message, great acting, great movie.",1
"Male loneliness is directly tied to the high value that we give to romantic relationships, as it tends undervalue any other form of love. It results in a current (and big) social problem: straight men who have zero valuable, deep and intimate relationships with people other than their girlfriends or wives. Men depend on women as a source for happiness through romantic love. That's why many straight men have no identity other than being a boyfriend, a husband, a provider.",1
"The Barbie movie is a such a sweet, fun movie. And absolutely hilarious. The whole theater was laughing. We laughed. We cried and we all danced. But we were lucky to have the best crowd at our showing which made the experience that much more enjoyable! So I highly recommend that you go to a good area to watch it. The people around can either make or break the sweet experience. It has been a long time since I've watched a movie that was actually clean and fun. The story is so entertaining. And the ending was absolutely amazing. The writers did an amazing job and the cast was absolute perfect in every way! God watch it. But get in your Barbie glam first!",1
"When the execution banks on shrewd humour and clever writing, the movie thrives as a vivid spectacle, as a lighthearted entertainer, but whenever it delves deeper than the surface and enthusiastically seeks for the hidden under-layers, the psyches of Barbie and Ken, their understanding of the world and their impaired perspectives, the output just becomes so much fuller, the film comes to be something else altogether.",1
So I went into the movie with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly impressed with the movie overall.,1
"The most fun I've had at the cinema in a long time. The jokes are meta and hilarious. The performances all through spectacular. This was like a fever dream and I can't wait to take all my friends to the cinema to watch this movie again and again. I did not expect to be so entertained but also shedding tears. A movie everyone should go and watch. And how beautiful that Billie Eilish song was! We will definitely hear it live next year at the Academy Awards, where I hope Greta and the whole team will get recognition for creating this (already) iconic film. Production design, script, directing, acting (especially Ryan bodied that role) and Best original song I would want to see awarded.",1
"Barbie is the latest toy turned movie adapation and stars Margot Robbie(Birds of Prey),Ryan Gosling(La La Land),Alexandra Ship(A Dogs Way Home),Dua Lipa,Will Ferrell(Elf),America Ferrara(Ugly Betty)and Helen Mirren(Shazam Fury Of The Gods) as the narrator.",1
This probably has been the biggest film of 2023.,1
"I think Barbie is one of the most powerful movies to impact the world! Portraying men as the women in todays society and American culture is brilliant to me. It's movies like this that will teach the young how unfair the world is and that's okay! The sooner we can help bring equality to the country, like it was made for, the sooner we can learn to help each other. I will say it's a shame Greta wasn't able to do things her way because I feel like it was very apparent how much the story changed midway, but either way It was a sweet message to every girl and their mothers, an acknowledgement to the struggles women face that men have little to no idea about. I really loved this movie and all the little allegories they used.",1
"I must admit, growing up I've had complicated feelings toward Barbie. In the beginning she was fun (my favorite was one of the mermaid Barbies), but growing up I distanced myself from the pink toy. It was no surprise I wasn't excited about the movie until I heard Greta was involved.",1
"I like what they did with this movie and the characters with its combining the Barbie world and the real world. Barbie starts getting ""vibes"" and has to go into the real world to find the girl who played with her to set things right and winds up in the Mattel headquarters. Something resembling chaos ensues. Ken joins her and winds up causing further damage. I like what they do in various stages of the story and with the characters. It was overall a very pleasant surprise snd a good movie with a good cast. Margot Robbie, Ryan
Gosling, America Ferrera, and Will Ferrell were all good in their roles. If you are a movie and/or a Barbie fan, you will love this movie.",1
"I watched this over the weekend and I can say downright that all the media attention and acclaim this movie has received is all truthful. This is a dark-gritty, wholesome and unconventionally humorous film that creates a dark and twisted yet fantastical and feminine adjunction towards the brand and the key themes it lays upon, themes of feminism, social roles, corporate greed, aging, legacies and divine intervention. It reads like a piece from epic poetry, as if the gods themselves had come down and made it. This is definitely the movie of 2023, and the wide range of actors just make it more convincing, I had my boyfriend drooling over ryan reynolds for the duration of the movie and I loved Margot Robbie's take on barbie. Loved this movie.",1
"I am neither a Barbie lover nor hater but I am a fan of great sets and creative films so I was prepared to put up with a bad story line to see the visuals but I LOVED it! So, so funny, Ryan Gosling was amazing as was everyone really. Haven't laughed so consistently in a film for ages. The end was slightly weaker so I've knocked off a point but regardless it's one of the best films I've seen in ages. The sets were amazing as I had hoped. I could have lived without the Will Ferrel character as it felt a little bit spoofy whenever he was on screen, a bit overacted but that's just a minor criticism in a brilliant movie. Well done team!",1
"It wasn't bad at all; it's funny and certainly worth watching. Margot Robbie delivers a brilliant performance and perfectly embodies the character, bringing the iconic toy to life.",1
"A difficult film to place. While it succeeds in entertaining and snatching a few healthy laughs-with quotes and jokes aimed mostly at an adept audience-it fails in my humble opinion in its underlying intention to convey a moral. The takeaways of the various Barbies, the monologues of the protoganist and her co-star are, in some ways, not only as anachronistic as they are predictable but all in all incomplete in their conclusions.",1
"As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the ""stereotypical Barbie"" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.",1
"I'm not a fan of modern day musicals. I strongly disliked LaLaLand, could never get through it. Barbie on the other hand I watched all the way through even though I thought it was sugary sweet. Ick. Peer pressure, ""ya gotta see it!"" The last 15 minutes of dialogue in the movie was very good. Actually wish I would have just watched that last 15 minutes rather than the entire movie. The actors/actresses I felt did a good job on their characters. It would have been better, in my opinion, if Barbie was an actual movie without all the plastic sets, the portal from land to sea etc. With all the technology out there surely the sets could have been realistic.",1
"I am going to be so shocked if this isn't the biggest movie of the year. Barbie was fun, hilarious, while also being real, and heart wrenching. I found myself laughing and crying throughout the film. The movie is incredibly well done, and the entire cast was phenomenal. I highly encourage everyone to watch the film, it perfectly balanced real, current issues while remaining a really fun film.",1
"""SUBLIME!""",1
"Don't get me wrong, I do love this movie. But the thing is i didn't really get the 'sad' hype that people gets from this, nonetheless, I really enjoyed how the movie talks about a lot of social issues especially the women oppression. I recommend this movie if you are really into entertainment and if you just wanna learn and talk about femininity. Really a hands down for Margot Robbie on this one. She did great on portraying Barbie and she looks just so freaking beautiful! Same goes to other Barbies in this movie- they are just so breathtaking.",1
"LOVED IT. Truly an amazing movie. A lot of people would maybe say that it's boring but to me it was super super cool, it held my attention from start to finish. Not just a movie this thing isnan experience that brings me so much joy if you go to the cinema. So many people there, dressed in pinkish clothes, feels like everyone there is happy and all of people there are unites under the idea of Barbie. The movie itself, has so many great messages to the word. I am sure a lot of little girls didn't quite understand it but they will one day. It also had so many real word/trensing things added to it.",1
"I may not have played with Barbie dolls and fairly no interest in this from a subject standpoint, but I have to say this movie rocks. Margot Robbie is awesome, Gerwig's direction is solid, the writing is well thought out, the colors pop, and let's not forget how amazing Ryan Gosling is in this. His Ken will go down in history as one of his best roles, calling it now. I do wish there were things that were more utilized in the film, especially Venice Beach as a location. It felt really shoe horned into the plot. Also some of the side characters just really didn't need to be there. But overall, this picture really works because it's messaging about the hardships of the modern woman is spot on. Also I liked how they actually critiqued Mattel at times for making a doll with insane beauty standards for young children. I'm definitely looking forward to see where Gerwig takes her career after this because this is truly a box office and critical smash that can lead to some interesting projects in the future.",1
It's a good movie. Walking out of it I knew people wouldn't like it considering we rarely have a women's actual point of view in cinema. It's actually quite funny seeing people's reactions to it as if everything that we were showed in the 2 hours of the movie isn't true.,1
"Greta's satire that evidently seems like a promotion run of Mattel's creations, is beyond the pink dazzle. The sugary-adorable pastels, mostly the pink colour spreads all over the dreamy world of Barbie. Everything that makes it fancy, fizzy and fantastic are the production designs and costumes. Ebullience is lightened by the sparkling musical sequences. The Fabulous Margot Robbie as Barbie is the eminence of this Greta's clever and creative vision. The Cast is typically perfect to saturate in the fantasy. Ryan Gosling charmingly lends a kenergy in the story. The ridiculous banters strives all the way, sometimes little silly but mostly unveils the story's themes. There's a brief mention of Mattel's creation & how they flawed at a place when they aimed to represent a powerful figure. There's a slight malfunction between the fantasy and real world that alters different ideologies to flourish in the fun and laughs. The ideologies shapes into leading an unresolved fragment of humankind. The two contrasting portraits, the Patriarchy & Feminism comes in a fairy tale that once again liberalise the women and evokes them to voice up for themselves and their dilemmas & demands for a treaty for their existence and admiration which is partly void in the flawed-society. The sweet messages are beneath the glaring pink world, that adds a soul in the story. Barbie's exploration in finding the answer to the malfunction leads to many errands along the way. She realises the elegance of tears, her purpose and worth, being imperfect is normal and ultimately the self-discovery immerses in the conclusion. A pink jest is a celebration of womanhood as the flashes of memories flow. Gradually it reaches to hearts of millions with its resembling storytelling. It turns into a tender-mellow tale of Barbie, growing up to understand the sentiments of a human much more. Indeed this elegantly crafted and insightfully written tale drives to a sentimental ending. The heart would be pink, the tears would be pink, hereby you'll love pink.",1
"I think the extensive hype and the long standing popularity of the Barbie brand are responsible for bringing several generations of fans into the theaters resulting in the opening sales. It certainly isn't the movie, itself. The storyline was overly simplistic, poorly written and I didn't find its style of absurd humor to be funny. The movie relied a lot on sight gags that I thought fell flat. The ending seemed to come out of the blue and was a poor attempt at profundity. Margot Robbie IS the consummate Barbie, but she pretty much plays ""actress Barbie"" in everything she does, so it wasn't anything groundbreaking for her. I thought Gloria and Sasha were the best characters and the combination of their performances along with the costumes and sets are the reason I gave the movie any stars at all. The concept of patriarchy certainly isn't anything new and IMO there are much better films on the subject - starting with any of the Jane Austin films and this director's other film - Little Women.",0
"From the get-go, Barbie hits hard with its spectacle and wit. The movie literally starts and ends itself in quips. But make no mistake, there is purpose and feeling to the film. It presents its core message boldly around its character's struggles, and subtly beneath its self-referential humor.",1
"The film has Margot Robbie and she's wonderful. Ryan Gossling is good but has been overhyped in this role. Will Farrell is doing his usual shtick, which is funny. However, the film seemed longer than Oppenheimer ( which is brilliant filmmaking). After twenty minutes I turned to a friend and asked if Barbie had a plot. Five minutes later a story did start to surface, but it was predicable and not terribly involving. Full disclosure: I never played with Barbie or destroyed a Barbie, so clearly I am not the intended audience. Still, there are some very clever bits, the design is super, the last line is a really laugh out loud surprise, and Robbie is a delight in anything.",1
"Without consumerism, without belief, without plastic accessory and hope for a perfect day, where would Barbie find herself?",1
"I watched this movie on an IMAX theater in my hometown (Qatif); it's considered a 70MM
cinema in our standards.. As everything was vividly pink, that particular experience made my eyes very sore!! Despite that, I can safely
say that the Barbie film is somehow a funny ridiculous film and I would confidently recommend to watch it over watching Nolan masterpiece of garbage (oppenheimer).",1
"Barbie (2023) offers a vibrant and empowering cinematic experience, delving deep into the themes of women empowerment and self-discovery. The movie serves as a poignant reminder of the valuable lessons it imparts to its audience. Through an engaging narrative, the film explores the resilience and strength of its characters, particularly Barbie, as they navigate the complexities of the world around them.",1
"Verdict: Filled with contexts and messages as rich as Oscar-nominated films, Barbie the Movie is a whole different game as it is full with surprises and hard-hitting truths about the world we live in today. It is self-aware of what it is and Greta Gerwig daringly takes charge of crafting a masterpiece storytelling that capitalizes on the heavy subjects without downgrading anything or anyone, maintaining both its quality and substance the entire film. You'll appreciate this 'life in plastic' film more than you can ever imagine. üíó",1
Wow. WOW!!!!,1
"The film is an enchanting mixture of sitcom, satire on consumer society and philosophy, where they dragged in everything they possibly could: from Pinocchio to the Bible. At the same time, the movie seems like a sketch from a talkshow that parodies cliches associated with the Barbie subculture.",1
"This thought-provoking movie is definitely not geared towards children or exclusively for girls; it's a must-watch for audiences of all backgrounds. It addresses delicate and fragile topics with precision. It was surprising and totally unexpected. Admittedly, the first half an hour is hard to get through, but you really get into it once you get the idea and you're totally consumed in it and already questioning yourself and the society before you realise. However, they could have concluded it better by finding a middle ground or presenting a solution to the problems addressed. Nevertheless, its overall impact makes it a must-see for everyone.",1
The movie is okay if you wanna have a laugh and entertainment.,1
"Margot Robbie is the best possible choice to play Barbie and Ryan Gosling is terrific as Ken. It's a very interesting story and not one I would automatically expect from a Barbie movie, but I love how it dives deep into the complexities of gender roles. It shows the negative impacts that a society dominated by one certain gender can have (female in Barbie Land and male in the real world) and we see why it's important to try and understand everyone's perspective. I also love how this movie dives into men's mental health with Ken's arc. It's something that gets overlooked in society and I adore how we got to see Ken learn to come to terms with who he is without Barbie and realize that he is enough just being himself. The movie gives a great arc to Barbie as she tries to understand her purpose. She realizes that the world of extreme happiness that she has been raised in isn't what she wants anymore. There are so many beautiful scenes where Barbie experiences the highs and lows of everyday humanity and in the end she chooses that she wants to become a real human. At first she starts off thinking that she's a great role model because she is always happy and positive but learns there are so many complexities to life that she was oblivious to. She becomes prepared to take on the challenge of being a human because she is desperate to feel something real. It's a great story and Greta Gerwig did a brilliant job directing. The set designs are very impressive and lots of shots are very beautiful. The movie is also very funny and the details and references to Barbie as a brand show just how much care was put into this movie. The music is incredible, there are so many songs in here that are great, but Ryan Gosling's performance of I'm Just Ken and Billie Eilish's What Was I Made For are my favorites. They do a great job representing the themes of the movie. If I had some complaints I think sometimes the movie is a bit heavy handed in its messaging and there are a couple of side characters that are a tad annoying but overall Barbie is a success. 8/10.",1
"I love Greta Gerwig so I knew I'd love this. It, however, exceeded my expectations and was a movie so great it broke through my expectations and my version of the real world. I will see this again as many times and with as many people or by myself that I can. This is one of the greatest films not only of the year, but of the decade, if not the century. If I sound like I'm over exaggerating it, for me, I am completely serious. Please go watch it with your mom, your dad, your lover, your sister, your brother, your best friend, or your worst enemy. It's worth it, it really really is. Bravo!!!!!!!",1
"Basically a Mattel remake of Heaven Can Wait: A person travels to a separate 'reality' to better understand who they are and what they have to offer in this world, and how the two worlds are connected. Add to it the fun movie opening rip off of 2001 Space Odyssey, it's hard to say that this is a very original movie. However, Margot Robbie brings it home and grounds the emotional side of the movie beautifully. The colour palette and the messages are worthwhile, ballsy directing and old for this role but excellent Gosling make it worth seeing. Will we remember this movie few years from now? No. But doesn't mean it's not worth seeing.",1
"This is the kind of movie I want my teenage daughter to grow up watching. To get to know and appreciate the flaws, strengths, and weaknesses that come with being a woman, whatever it is, 'Because Barbie can be anything, WE can be anything'.",1
People who followed all the lawsuits and all the Barbies throughout the years. It broke every single Hollywood Law in the books. Mattel made Satire out of their own overprotection of the Barbie Product. Margot Robbie was a breath of fresh air when she produced and starred in Barbie. This is one movie for both males and females and those who absolutely HATE Barbie. It is pure comedy and will never stop laughing throughout the whole movie.,1
"I went to see the movie with the feeling it was being hyped to much and with not so high expectations, -even though I admire Greta Gerwig a lot- but not even fifteen minutes into the movie I was already laughing and crying and hooked. It is definitely one of the funniest I've seen in at least 2 years, it has a simple storyline that works exactly as it suppose to without trying to be something else. The message is powerful and easy to understand, I found it refreshing and truthful, sometimes it may feel even a bit naive, but in the end it is what it is and I appreciated that. The performances are really delightful and full of small nuances that make them easy to connect with, even though the tone is satiric and farcical. Great movie, a lot more than I expected.",1
The film was good and there were scenes that were fun to watch. One thing it failed was being funny and there were a couple of overrated scenes. It was entertaining and many people who have seen it or are about see it would agree with me. I would not see it again anytime more this year but maybe in two years I would watch it again. There is definitely way too much hype and at least in my opinion it is not as good as everyone is saying it is. This is most money and the most successful movie a Warner bros movie has been. The certain people that would love this movie is girls. Also women and men age 30 - 50. If you a women or girl or a men I would definitely recommend this film.,1
"Barbie vs Oppenheimer, was an amazing event to take place, if you want to say they were even going against each other, it was very enjoyable to see this take place though.",1
"My mother was the only person I could convince to go watch Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" (2023) with me, and ""wow"" am I glad we went. It's been a while since I've seen such a genuinely fun and creative movie. Originality is what the world has been longing for!",1
"So I watched this movie a few days ago and I think it is one of the most intelligent movies I have ever watched. From the first time I watched the trailer I knew this movie would be different I knew it wouldn't be just about a doll and it would have something more. And I was correct. These movie is about existational crisis, finding who you are and your purpose.",1
"I honestly cannot understand those rating on here. The first half ot the movie is exactly what I expected from a barbie movie; it's fun, it's pink and it was just a great watch but then (oh lord) the second half started. Although I understand that the producers try to address certain issues in society but this has absolutely no place in a Barbie movie. I don't really enjoy it when a highly extravaganted issues is being shoved into my face. I honestly cannot understand how the producers thought that's the way to do it. It leaves a bitter taste behind and destroys the good vibes from the beginning of the movie. I'm extremely disappointed.",0
"I'll start with the issues, because overall this movie was enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously.",1
"I know this review is like a month late but if you haven't already watched barbie you really should. I thought this would be a fun or child like movie but I ended up crying at the end. I found it very heartwarming, it's genuinely a good movie. In this movie Barbie try's to find her true self while wondering what her worth and purpose is and understand herself. It also has some funny jokes I liked in the movie. I think this movie is an absolute masterpiece, both funny and sad. I would personally rate this movie ten out of ten especially if you're into heartwarming and I guess somewhat relatable. I highly recommend this :).",1
"So, I just wanna say that I was very hyped for this movie. But after I watched this, I was a bit disappointed.",1
"It's safe to say I went into barbie with pretty low expectations and honestly went into it with pretty low expectations because hey, it's the barbie movie. And while it may not have been the best movie released on the 21st of July 2023 it certainly blew my expectations away. It was super unique and honestly one of the funniest movies I'd seen in a while. Like it did a phenomenal job of balancing its comedic element and its storytelling elements and together we're able to give out a really powerful message for men and women of all ages. And like all of the songs in this movie were unironically really good. And ryan gosling was shirtless for most of the movie. 9.4/10.",1
"This movie was an aesthetic dream . Just looking at it was a treat . Scene to scene , color schemes , outfit choices . This kept you drawn in and you wanted to keep looking - even if you didn't like anything else - the straight up visual was worth it .",1
Synopsis: Barbie (Played by Margot Robbie) suddenly starts to notice that she is slowly turning away from being the stereotypical Barbie doll with a few changes happening to her. This forces Barbie to discover the real world as well as herself and her purpose as a doll.,1
I had no idea what to expect going into Barbie. I had no interest in seeing a movie about Barbie but was immediately sold on the highly talented Margot Robbie and the awesome Ryan Gosling. But I was still nervous that the comedy would be aimed strictly at women and would be difficult for a guy to enjoy.,1
"The Margot Robbie/Ryan Gosling curiosity BARBIE is a subversive film. This Greta Gerwig directed move lures you in by presenting a farcical/satirical look at the pastel colored ""Barbieland"" and the myriad of outfits and ""golly-gosh"" goodness of the world of this iconic Mattel doll (and her boyfriend, Ken). Once you are comfortably settled into this world, you are transformed to the ""real world"" and the much deeper themes of a women's place in a patriarchal world.",1
"The theatre was filled to the brim with 99% women and girls wearing pink, we felt united in the moment of watching such a beautiful film. It's a comedy but it also offers a glimpse into the real world and what it's like for girls and women daily. It was beautiful and i can only wish for more people to go and see it. The laughs and the jokes were only a small portion of the emotions we felt we could just let out, it was emotional in the best way possible and was a moment that i am thankful i could share with my bestfriend. Directors like Greta Gerwig are what we need in this world for it to be complete.",1
"I have questions: when the kens take over Barbie land, they see the Barbies as just accessories but then when the Barbies just swap places every ken still had a Barbie why would they even care as long as they still have a pretty thing listening? I just feel like that scene was kind of random and odd I guess. I still enjoy the film overall it was very visually appealing. Will ferrells character was just cheap laughs, nothing new for him. He's too childlike to believe he intends any ill will for barbie so it really takes the wind out of the movies sails. Also the parallels between this and don't worry darling and they have the same flaw in my opinion. An unclear driving force of why this is happening now - randomly thinking about death? I would have preferred to have seen her be picked up in the real world and then the reveal that it was gloria and not the daughter could have been a more significant moment and they could have fleshed out Gloria's yearning for girlhood more and why she played with the dolls.",1
"Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.",1
"I really enjoyed this movie and its message. I wish the underlying meaning to the story was a little more subtle, but it was good nonetheless.",1
"I like the overall feeling of the movie. It was created so beautifully and with such care and creativity and love for the Barbie universe
It was also so silly and fun.",1
"It truly surprises me how greta gerwig revolutionizes the film industry, with a movie that's seemingly so simple and ""childlike"" and turning it into a life lesson and still keeping the fun in it. It has so many fun elements in it but still gives off its message so clearly. How well it was filmed and directed was truly astounding to see how it was not only visually beautiful and aesthetically pleasing but also the writing and the acting. Every part of this movie was well thought out and it shows. My only critique is that the pace at the ending was a bit too fast and random but it ultimately makes sense in the movie so it's excusable.",1
This film is a mess. I understand the film has become politicized by now but just from a filmmaking perspective the film is all over the place.,0
"This movie moved me deeply. I am a 20-year-old girl and to finally see a movie that deals with gender inequality and patriarchy in such an intelligent way was something I really did not expect. Very satisfied. Hearing and seeing an acknowledgement of our current situation as a society was absolutely necessary. During several scenes of the film I literally had tears in my eyes because I finally felt understood. The message in my opinion is clearly expressed. It is up to the viewer to perceive it. Anyone who thinks that the ending expresses the superiority of barbies over ken is missing the point, they are completely off the mark. Not only women's issues are shown in the movie, but also men's issues. I highly recommend viewing also for men, without prejudice and with the will to understand. Nothing more to add, a masterpiece that deals with very topical social issues that we needed. Thank you Barbie.",1
"The Barbie movie is a film that fails to captivate its audience. The plot is lackluster and the characters are underdeveloped, making it difficult to become invested in the story The movie is slow-paced and boring, making it a struggle to sit through from beginning to end.",0
"I went into this movie thinking it would be super preachy and all about feminism, but I found that many people have had different views or takeaways from the movie. I interpreted the overall point of the movie to be that today's feminism has gone a little overboard and has put way too much pressure on women to feel like we have to be the career driven, leader boss b*itch to have a meaningful life. This movie voices that sometimes women (while respecting the women that do) don't want to be a leader, who's a mom and has the career. Sometimes we just want to be average and that's ok. I also felt the mother and daughter scenes in the movie tug at my heart and GG did a great job and adding those pieces throughout the movie. While I agree that it was annoying how the Kens were treated at the beginning of the movie, I felt the ending tied it all together. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. As humans I think we sometimes find ourselves wondering what was I made for? And even though this was referring to Barbie, it can be very relatable.",1
"""Thus Spake Zarabarbie"" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's ""Barbieland"". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink ""Groundhog Day"". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned ""Ken"" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a ""Barbie"". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical ""Barbie"" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See ""Weird Barbie"" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted ""Ken"" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by ""Sasha"" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Ferrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged ""Ken"" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend ""Sasha"", her much less cyclical mother ""Gloria"" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever ""Carla"" from ""Cheers!"") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole ""Barbie"" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is.",1
"The latest installment in the Barbie movie franchise takes an unexpected turn, veering away from the child-friendly themes that fans have come to expect. In this new adventure, Barbie finds herself navigating the complexities of the real world, facing a stark realisation that men rule the world - much to Ken's delight.",1
"Iconic. The set, the outfits, the decor, the styling was iconic. I loved that the words and tones they used were as if a child was playing with them, but the topics were more serious and meaningful. They gave such a creative and fun spin to everything. I had many moments where I thought ""how did they even come up with all of this"". I like to be positively surprised in a movie and the conversations and jokes were so fun and fitting to the movie and the vibe, everything was well thought of and I could not help but smile every time. It's very extravagant and light and fun. It's not a movie for people who like deep dialogues and dramatic emotions in films. It is meant to be easy to digest, fun, extra and make you smile. I find it a brilliant concept and a refreshing, lightweight movie. I loved it. Very Girly and fun.",1
"I never ever expected to watch this film. I thought that it would be a decent Hollywood movie, but not something that I had any interest in. Then everyone started going to see it wearing pink and getting photos in Barbie boxes, and they came out raving about it, and someone posted That Monologue by America Ferrera, and suddenly I didn't want to miss out.",1
"A breath of fresh air, what an inspirational film on so many levels. Gretta showing the world of screenwriting just how it's done. I can't wait to see what new wave this brings to our cinemas. And what stories it inspires in younger generations of female creatives. If you don't agree, you're missing the point. Watch it again and listen to the subtext. And look around you, how many people came wearing pink? Don't underestimate the pink pound!",1
"I thought Barbie was an ok movie, especially by recent standards. It was a whimsical, borderline funny movie that presented both femininity and masculinity in both toxic and healthy versions. Part of the movie that isn't brought up much is that during the first few minutes, Barbie World, which is completely matriarchal, is shallow and plastic. Life in Barbie World is boring. Which is why after Ken brings the patriarchy from the real world almost everyone is on board. It's different and fun. Then when Barbie returns, Barbie and a couple of others use deception and manipulation to win back power. Just like some aspects (some, not all) of the patriarchy, deception and manipulation are evil too. Then after Barbie finally sees Ken's dilemma, instead of only focusing on herself, she supports him. It's Barbie and its Ken. The message of the movie is not down with the patriarchy, nor is it anti matriarchy. The message of the movie is life is hard, with ups and downs and then you die, so we should support each other. Just like how some women see sexism everywhere or how some nonwhites see racism everywhere; I think the prevalence of anti-male propaganda in modern ""entertainment"" has led some people to see male bashing everywhere. I think this movie was balanced in its fault finding and the core message was to support each other.",1
"A fun and clever enough comedy and twist on the world's most famous doll with wonderful production values, a charming Margot Robbie and an absolute hilarious Ryan Gosling.",1
"For starters this movie was made by women for women. I was not the intended audience, which is fine. But I feel like there is a good story somewhere hidden here, or there could have been one. That everyone could have really liked.",1
"First things first, what was good about this movie. There was no better choice for Barbie than Margot Robbie she's lovely and brilliant. Ryan is also Kenough.",1
"As much as it pains me to give a movie called ""Barbie"" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.",1
"8.5/10
While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.",1
"I should be the target audience. I am a woman in her thirties that grew up playing with Barbie dolls. Malibu barbie, Stacy, Skipper, Ken and the likes.",0
"My husband asked me to compare this to something else to ally, and my first thought was Elf. In these ways it lives up to one of the greatest movies of all time - both are hilarious, have wonderful musical numbers, heartwarming, will make you tear up, complicated parental storylines, unlikely character bonding, and whimsical visual tie-ins/world-building + bonus of both having Will Ferrel to boot.",1
"So many people have watched this movie and have absolutely dissected it to be something it isn't. Just sit back, relax, don't overthink it and it's so enjoyable. A good laugh and light hearted film. Would definitely recommend. It's funny, crazy and random but it's written so well. The little comments and mentions of certain things by certain characters make you chuckle. The story is good because it isn't just a movie of barbie. It covers what barbie was and who barbie was and where barbie went and also Ken and Allan. They cover all areas and manage to keep it light on the story and feelgood at the end.",1
"Greta Gerwig, you've done it again. There's a reason this movie has become such a phenomenon in modern culture and that's because it's always been a hit!",1
"Where to begin? With flamboyance of Barbie and the emotions of Greta Gerwig, this is the best release of the year so far. To address it all to mothers, specifically, and STILL touch the hearts of girls all around. To talk so, SO honestly about what it's like being a girl. To say it in the first ten minutes - ""I can have feelings and use logic at the same time and it does not take away from my worth."" to have Barbie look at her body and hate it and to make her look at an old woman and see just how beautiful her ""imperfections"" make her. To make it about growing up, but also about remaining a child. To remind girls to be both. To make the perfect example of what adolescence means to a girl. Just genius.",1
"For a movie about a line of plastic dolls, it managed to be the most deeply human movie to come out in a while. I've don't think that I've walked out of theater at the end of a movie with the feeling of so much solidarity with the folks around me and I'm already trying to make a plan for seeing it again in theaters.",1
"Even though I'm male but this movie is amazing I love how barbie land is made out of plastic and the costumes were great including Margot Robbie herself, she likes like a barbie in real life and Ryan really looks like Ken. This movie had so much joy and very entertaining but the ending was unexpected but barbie made her be own choice to become human that way she will be able to be herself and she chose her own decisions.",1
"I went to see this movie after hearing all kinds of ""propaganda"" about it so I wasn't sure what to expect. I absolutely loved it! It was hilarious, thought provoking, inspirational, and an all around great movie. Definitely geared towards adults but the jokes that may be mildly inappropriate (and I do mean MILDLY) will go over kids' heads. I loved seeing the character arcs and how each of them grew and changed ultimately for the better by the end of the film. While I was I initially hesitant to go and see it I loved it and would absolutely watch again. I recommend this movie whether you love Barbie or have mixed feelings.",1
"Hilarious, fun, poignant, smart, and satirical. As a middle-aged mother of 4, I related to Gloria SO MUCH. And I cried. Boy did I cry. Much like Everyone Everywhere All At Once, I felt SEEN. For all the critics of the movie, my response is, 1. (Quoting Jack Nicholson) YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH, and 2. ITS SATIRE, FOLKS! But like most satire, it flies over the heads of many. Many stereotypes are addressed in an obvious way, but others are subtle. Not going because you don't want to support what you've heard is a political ""side"", well, that's just ridiculous. Give yourself more credit than that.",1
"I did not know what to expect from the Barbie movie when I went with my two adult daughters. I was very pleasantly surprised! The movie made me laugh and it sometimes brought a tear to my eye (but I mostly laughed through it). The sets are spectacular. I would not be surprised if the movie wins an Academy Award for at least the set design. Ryan Gosling is very funny as the underrated Ken and Margot Robbie is very well suited to play the iconic doll. A very good commentary on how, sometimes, the Real World works. The story was, at times, very touching, but it's mostly a really good time. I loved it!!",1
"With movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Beau Is Afraid having come out recently, Barbie is the next in a line of a clearly developing trend of absurdism, meta commentary, and surrealism to create a wacky, funny, beautiful, and touching film about some type of social commentary. With Barbie, we get commentary on feminism, consumerism, and existentialism. It leans perfectly into its brightly colored world and plasticky fakeness to help elevate its commentary and rich cast. The costume, makeup, and set design are lavishly created and I wouldn't be surprised if it won Oscars for all of these categories. The cast does a fantastic job, and I don't think there could have been a better Ken or Barbie. Greta Gerwig was always going to make this more than just a family movie. It's a feminist masterpiece chock full of over the top pop culture nods, perfectly timed comedic quips, and genuine emotional moments that make you think.",1
"This movie was incredible, it so perfectly portrays the patriarchy and feministic ideas. It really stood out to me how the worst the Kens had to go through in Barbieland was being ignored and being not very important, while the second Barbie went to the real world she was harassed and objectified. It ended up STILL being up to Barbie to ""apologize"" to Ken at the end of the movie though she did nothing wrong! This movie was hilarious and saddening and perfect, and it did a fantastic job of showing patriarchal things and balancing the serious and sad, with the funny and tender moments. I love Great Gerwig and would for sure see this again.",1
"I was really excited to see Barbie, but sadly the film came up short for me.",0
I went to see Barbie with the highest of expectations and it did not disappoint.,1
"The movie is colourful, fun and had a message about the, State of the world as it is today. I get the feminist message but it feels like a little exposion on how the events of the plot panned out would have helped complete it.",1
"Barbie's first live action movie revives the name of the toy franchise created by Mattel that after many years seemed to be forgotten along with other titles like Max Steel. This film manages to revive this franchise by presenting us with a magical world made up of many of the versions of Barbie and Ken that have been made throughout history. Barbieland recreates many of the elements and characteristics of the toys that marked the childhood of many girls. The movie is quite colorful, cartoony and wacky, with a rather childish goofiness and cartoonish humor that can if it can make some people cringe. She has all the femininity that has always characterized the Barbie franchise and becomes feminine enough to respect the vision of the franchise, while adapting to current times. Margot Robbie is very charismatic in her role as Barbie and Ryan Gosling manages to play a very nice Ken.",1
"""Barbie"" (2023 release; 114 min) opens with a nice twist/spoof on ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" regarding the arrival of Barbie dolls (as opposed to baby dolls). We then go to ""BarbieLand"" as Barbie wakes up and starts a new and perfect day. Alas, the next day is anything but perfect, and Barbie must go to the real world to fix things...",1
I got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.,1
"I recently watched this movie with my daughter. I expected a nice movie but the story is lousy and I thought it was not funny. I think the movie should be fine for my niece of 9 years old but for me I did not understand what the fuss was about. It was predictable, bad story. The begin started simple and when whe went to the real world there was so much more that could have been done but instead the story if very simple and no depth. Well maybe I am just to old for it haha.",0
The film does not live up to the marketing. Its about as subtle as a steamroller and deep as a puddle. There must be primary school books with more depth and nuance than this film.,0
"Barbie surprised me in all the best ways. It was funny, moving, inspirational, and all around ridiculously entertaining. I mean that with every sense of the implication to.",1
"Margot Robbie had a vision, and she was the driving force to get the Barbie movie produced by none other than world-class director Greta Gerwig.",1
I'm so happy with the casting that I can look past some other issues. It wasn't as nostalgic as I would have wanted it to be but this is definitely a new generations barbie movie. It really checked all the boxes with me. Fun costumes and great performances. It was fantasy and also very real. I can't think of anyone that could ever be better as Barbie than Margot Robbie. This was the perfects storm and it was a long time coming. Greta Gerwig's directing was fun and the script was inspiring. This movie won't be for everyone for sure but as a long time barbie fan I'm pleased. They left the movie in the perfect place and I don't need more. One and done and I'm ok with it.,1
This movie is not for people who cry a lot. It was a beautiful movie with proper cinematic gold.,1
"This movie is refreshingly intelligent and visually enchanting. The script is quite clever and fun, and get this: there is not one word of profanity. (This just goes to show that a blockbuster movie can be well-written and need not have dozens of f-bombs.) I give it even more bonus points for good actors who don't mumble. I was beginning to think that today's actors had forgotten that diction was a vital tool in their box. How refreshing to hear every word! Though it carries a powerful message about female empowerment, this is not a movie just for women. My husband enjoyed it very much. Young children won't get most of it, but they might enjoy the visuals. Highly recommended.",1
"Oppenheimer was bad. In a bad way. And when I reviewed it, I was thought everything would have been better to watch than that. And finally, I had the opportunity to watch Barbie. I thought it will be a tipical advert film, where yes, they make joke from the dolls and there's some jokes for the adults too, but overall it's all about: BUY MORE BARBIE !",1
"Greta Gerwig continues to prove herself as a leading filmmaker in today's industry. In what is one half of the ""Barbenheimer"" experience, many would be quick to assume that given the subject matter, ""Oppenheimer"" is the superior film that makes you think, while ""Barbie"" is the film where you turn your brain off and enjoy the silliness. And while the movie is undeniably silly, it proves throughout its runtime that it's something more. ""Barbie"" is beautiful, bold, and (somewhat) brilliant.",1
"The movie was unexpectedly fun starting from all the references related to the actual Barbie doll to the costumes and till even the Barbie world itself. Overall I think there is a good balance between satire and sincerity, crammed with impeccable attention to details. Even tough as a watcher I expected Barbie to be the star of the show, in many moments Ken was actually such a fun scene-stealer that at one point I felt the movie should truly be Barbie and Ken.",1
"This movie is an excellent marketing product. Cinemas were full, Even in Baku city. It was very difficult to find tickets. People dressed in pink clothes were coming to this event. I wore my black shirt and went. I think the movie was not good. I fell asleep in some scenes. There were lots of boring speeches. The movie was fun, that's obvious, but I didn't laugh much. This movie became one of the most different and crazy events of our day. I don't think it has any value as a movie. It was indeed a bad movie, but as an event it was fun. I don't regret. There were some references. I liked most of them. The acting wasn't bad, I think it was good. I was getting bored again near the end of the movie. Anyway, I think it was a crazy and fun event, but it was a bad movie.",1
"This movie should be seen by everyone in my opinion. Literally. I don't care if you don't like Barbies or pink, because this movie is so much more than that. It makes both women and men feel valid about their experiences and highlights how unequal our whole world currently is. The movie is also very comedic and has some really cool easter eggs about Barbie dolls and the development Barbie. The movie was very mature in my opinion and isn't necessarily a kids movie even though it's called ""Barbie"", a doll. It didn't have too much K18 references but sexual harassment towards the main character was present so that should be taken into account when wanting to see the film with a child.",1
"I was deciding on a movie to watch when eventually I decided on the barbie movie because why not, I went in thinking this would be a childish type movie but I was actually quite surprised to say the least. I can see where people are coming from with all the negativity but I personally did not mind it! The camerawork was pretty good, the acting was good though it can get cheesy at certain times, the story wasn't bad but it wasn't perfect or amazing. But the best thing about the movie is how fun it is, you can sit down after school, work, stressful or busy day and you just lay back and have a good time! I do recommend it to people who want a fun experience. Although if your looking for a serious, action filled, 10 star movie, this is probably not for you.",1
"I wanted a girly movie with humor, amazing looks, and a feminist plot. A true show for the ladies. And this gave me that and more. So many profound moments, so many funny lines, such good acting, the cinematography was beautiful, the sets were perfect, the outfits were on point. First girls movie I love with no overt emphasis on a romantic relationship. Just a beautiful, complex, funny story about barbie. Everyone was perfectly casted. I was nervous about all the young children in the audience but there was no sexual scenes, little cursing, and most innuendo seemed to go over their heads. Loved the light this movie shed.",1
"As I stated in the title of this review first and foremost this movie is absolutely worth your time, especially with a rather short run-time that is an hour and fifty minutes.",1
"So I love this movie so much I just don't understand why many men's don't like it I love Margot Robbie and Ryan gosling performance and the movie really inspired me everyday because this movie is all about finding yourself, accepting who you are, and being imperfect is a normal things like barbie I don't have a problem with this movie this movie deserve to win an Oscar because the music is very good and the acting and so all this movie deserves good rating because this movie giving us lessons about life about so many expectations about women I really love this movie highly recommend to all of you.",1
"You will experience vast emotions during this film. It's a thrill to watch, funny and fresh comedy. If I had any critiques for the film, I'd put them, but I enjoyed watching and will rewatch it. I felt like a little kid again at the movies. Totally absorbed with the story. It's a fictional land, while the film is so raw. Margot Robbie is a joy to watch and showed an impressive performance. I believed she was Barbie. The movie is played out as if the characters are dolls being played with. I imagined being a kid with my dolls, thinking of similar outrageous plots, dialogue, and wardrobe changes. Anyone can enjoy this film.",1
"I am truly shocked by how much I liked this movie. I'd heard all the hype but thought I would hate it. I was never a Barbie girl and was often in trouble as a child for abusing my sister's and cousins' dolls but this movie! Very funny (and touching) and SO beautiful. The cast is perfect, the set designs are phenomenal and, from start to finish, everything is very well thought out. I took a star off because I thought the dream ballet was a bit much but even that made sense after I listened to the extras on the disc and heard the director tell why she included the sequence. The movie is not a children's movie and now I understand why so many adults have gone to see it.",1
"Barbie is, in its very core, a comedy, and a funny one at that. From the opening scene, Greta Gerwig set up the mood that will run thru the entire movie. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both amazing, but the rest of the big ensemble is a mixed bag. This is mostly because of the writing. Will Ferrells character served no more purpose than advertise the Mattel company as goofy and ""self aware"". The third act slows the movie down, which is a shame as the first and second acts are very strong. However, when Barbie delivers it delivers. The set design are beautifully artificial. Barbie sometimes shows strokes of genius, but fails to deliver a strong end.",1
"A fantastic satirical drama on patriarchy blended with witty humor, fabulous direction, and fabulous acting.",1
I didn't care for the movie. I even started to doze off a couple of times and had to force myself to stay awake.,0
"Barbie: the symbol of pink, pastel perfection. An iconic piece of American pop culture for more than 50 years. But nothing can prepare you for her big screen debut.",1
"It was beautiful and brilliant, didn't expect it's gonna be too good. Greta tells the -ve side of the real world beautifully wrapped in humor and childhood nostalgia for many.",1
"I think everybody should watch this movie. This movie will change someones perspective of the world. If someone hates on this movie is because they did not understand the message and meaning behind it. Margot Robbie did an excellent job portraying Barbie. Would totally rewatch this movie. This movie made me laugh, cry, and made me think about my childhood. Its such a beautiful movie. Greta Gerwig is one of the best directors of this generation. Truly the best movie released this year. She even broke box office record for female directors. LOVE BARBIE AND EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"The Barbie movie is an absolute delight! It captivates audiences with its fantastic songs, creating a truly enchanting experience. The fun and engaging story will keep you hooked from start to finish, and the clever humor ensures there are plenty of laughs throughout the film. Plenty of Ken and Barbie for everyone. Makes everyone feel like they have a part to play. It's a must-watch for all ages, as it beautifully brings the beloved Barbie character to life in a way that leaves a lasting impression. Don't miss out on this enjoyable and mesmerizing cinematic adventure! Also, there is nothing after the end credits.",1
Not sure what to think about this movie but Margot Robbie is always great to watch and Ryan gosling is consistently great in all his movies these two definately ups my rating of the movie. Was left feeling a little bit underwhelmed! I might just watch it again because I'm sure I missed something in the plot the first time. The soundtrack is perfect for this very colourful film especially Billie eilish What was I made for and would be a shame if it didn't win an Oscar for best song at next years awards ceremony. Overall it was a pleasant watch but like all movies which are overhyped I wanted something moreüëç,1
"I like F-Rating movies, to know and understand women, especially the hidden value of feminism around the story scenario, and of course there is no doubt what makes it Grate Gerwig. Although this time, there is no Saoire Ronan in my opinion is the best chemistry between directors and actresses for female films. This work Barbie, comes set in Barbieland's fantasy that depicts the irrational of a woman. The moving plot of the Barbie fantasy world, conflict increases when entering the world of reality, and the ending is resolved according to the maturity of the story, which is a red herring type of plot; what is meant is that the author diverts the audience's minds, as in this film Barbie has to correct flat soles, but it is not the essence of the Basically the director wants to convey the feminine phase, with an amazing fantasy idea, between the difference between the world of reality and the world called Barbieland.",1
"This movie is AWESOME! Unexpected in so many good ways. Addresses so many social issues and complicated conversations in a fun, fair, and thoughtful way. What a joyful blend of comedy, music, color and memories from childhood. Every frame is filled with so much visual candy, and if you ever owned a Barbie or Ken or skipper or Alan you will not be disappointed by the costumes or sets. The actors, editing, directing, writing and set design are a solid 10. I don't think the previews do this movie justice, it was so much more than I expected. Mattel managed to pull this kaleidoscope of a movie off; kudos to the believers of this script. It is so worth seeing once, twice, three times and then some!",1
"Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie. Of course she's incredibly beautiful, talented, funny, and hip; however, I didn't have some life-altering epiphany, like so many others did. I actually thought the film was way too cheesy, 45 minutes too long, and also confusing at times. I love the originality and strong feminist viewpoint, the idea of Ken learning about misogyny and sexism, essentially bringing these twisted ideas to Barbieland, leading all Barbies to succumb to a more subservient role, while ultimately forcing them to rediscover their own power, talents, intelligence, and individuality. But after an hour or so, I kept thinking, ""Why can't Barbie just sing a song?!"" I wanted a fluffier, comedic Barbie, while what I got was a doll having an existential crisis. It was depressing at times. The cast was phenomenal, of course. I just didn't expect it to be such a mess in terms of storytelling.",1
"I went and saw this with one of my best friends and it was a quite ride. We laughed, we cried, we had a great time! Barbie was definitely one of the best films we've seen all year! This was relatable on so many levels! I personally felt that there really is something in this movie for everybody! It pokes fun at the way society is but does it in a way that makes you really think about how you are living in this world. It has also made me decide to add more color into my everyday life as well! The entire cast was absolutely incredible in making this film both be true to what Barbie is to little girls and what it did for children growing up!",1
I'm not a Barbie fan. The only time I loved Barbie was when she was in the Toy Story movies. But that changed after I saw the Barbie movie. This movie is not only Greta Gerwig's best film but also the year's greatest movie so far!!!!! Margot Robbie (my favorite actress of all time) is beautiful and portrays Barbie with pure perfection!!! And then there's Ken (played by Ryan Gosling in a career-best performance)!!! Robbie and Gosling shine and are easily the years best duo.,1
"If you want to educate yourself on patriarchy, read Virginia Woolf. The creation or viewing of this movie are horrible ways to raise your awareness about women's rights. It feels like writers were out of ideas an hour into the movie. The movie tries to have some sense of humor but hurts the main idea more than defending it while trying to make jokes about stereotypes of today.",0
"It was funny, gorgeously done and challenged people's view points which is a lot done for a movie made by a toy company. I found myself laughing and tearing up at certain points. I was in awe while watching it in the theaters for the attention to detail on props. It's insane how well made it is.",1
"(let me apologize for my english beforehand)
Oh my gosh... I don't even know where to start. I was very exited to watch this movie, and I decided to go see it for the first time with my best friend with whom I used to play barbies. However, I did not expected the movie to be so emotional: I cried in four different moments. In particular, the scene with the eldery woman on the bench makes me cry everytime I think about it! This movie touches a lot of parts about womanhood that we rearly get to see on the big screen, it critizes and in someways explains the patriarchy in a vey obvious way, whitch makes me think that the (mostly) men who are complaining about it have probably seen the movie with their eyes closed.",1
Just saw 'Barbie' today directed by Greta Gerwig. It is a bit difficult to rate. Slow to start - a tedious first 30 or 40 mins. Didn't like the lift from 2001 either. But the latter half with Gosling somewhat makes up for the beginning. His musical number was fantastic.,1
I only saw this movie for Ryan gosling and I was not disappointed. Bro brought the humor into this movie like he does with every movie that he is in. His performance was impeccable and kenough. To be fair I was a bit high so I was laughing a lot in the theatres and I was with my gf also seeing the movie. And I just love how Ryan aka ken brought the character to life in a special way. And of course the song he made is just absolutely wonderful in everyway. One of his best performances ever highly recommend for kids and for families to go and enjoy themselves. As Ryan gosling would say I'm just Ken and I'm enough.,1
"I went in there with O expectations, but boy, it was cunning and audacious to say the least! It is one the most original movie made in terms of writing, filming, cinematography, in recent times to be made with a fake subject but very relevant plot!",1
"""Barbie"" to me is one of the harder movies to review because I don't know whether I liked it or not. This review will just come from the hip and i'm going to list the good and the bad and finally rate it off of what i've reviewed, so here goes...",1
"The surface-level: Barbie is vibrant, fun, and immensely enjoyable. Robbie and Gosling are stellar, and Gerwig's camera has never been in better focus.",1
"As someone who played with the dolls growin up,the in-jokes and references to some rare Barbie variations and playsets are funny. The political message gives Barbie a new dimension I never thought would go to. I felt a hidden anti-war message in it actually which is deep for a toy I never thought would be taken that serious. Makes sense in order to explain the historical connotations about the franchise's history,but on rewatch I'll fast forward to the cheesy funny parts. Would I watch it again? Probably!!!!!!!! Especially after eating a pot cookie,bet this movie would look crazier! After watching I feel I'm on a Barbie kick and searching for the toys.",1
So many positive messages for women and men alike! Barbie has an existential crisis and Ken embraces the worst of the patriarchy. Both just seeking deeper meaning - what were they made for? Meaningful subtext while being wildly entertaining!,1
"The long-awaited and well-publicized Barbie movie is a way for Mattel to apologize for the mistakes they made, to achieve greater acceptance of the new generations, trying to imply that they are going to change those mistakes, but doing it in the best way. Form of advertising possible. Visually it is a colorful and striking film, which reminds us of many Barbie ester eggs, recalling many things from childhood (I was never really a Barbie fan). It is a friendly film for adults and children, I think that each age group will understand according to
be age. I knew that it couldn't be a bad movie since it has a very good director, luckily they decided to change the initial actress since the movie would be another story. It is a criticism using humor, about feminism, machismo, patriarchy, about what women face (I had never thought that Barbie was nominated by women, however her mistake was wanting perfectionism), about existential doubts, the world dominated by men on many occasions, the relationships of mothers and adolescents, the daily routine, trying not to fall into this routine and procrastinate, I think it is a film that, being well analyzed, has very good components and a very good plot, something that one never imagined from a movie about Barbie.",1
"I really thought this would just be a cute movie, but it actually had a very deep message and I really hope people can take the messages away from this movie because there was a few. I think they did great with the Barbie movie. It was entertaining. The special effects were adorable, but the message was so HUGE in this movie.",1
"Film Barbie was directed by Greta Gerwig. It stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. The film is set in Barbie Land and Real World. It was filmed mostly in UK. The story starts in our time in Barbie Land. One day her feet are getting flat and she goes to Weird Barbie for advice,she sends her to the Real World. Ken hides in the car and goes with Barbie. There Barbie founds out very upset things,but Ken the exact opposite. He brings his knowledge of patriarchy into Barbie land and everything goes upside down. In the end Barbies and Alan save Barbie Land.",1
I'm only writing this due to the misperception of this movie. I saw the movie opening night with my GF who loved and still loves Barbie. She is stereotypical Barbie and she dressed up in pink and had a wonderful time. If you're a fan of Barbie you can stop reading here and just go see the movie you will love it.,1
"At the beginning, it cleverly reflects social issues through gender reversal, but not merely as a reversal. Both gender groups retain their essence, and the ending isn't about one group's victory over the other, but about working together. It encompasses not only gender equality but also recognition and acceptance of others and oneself. It's not about feminism, patriarchy, or gender confrontation. It's not about stereotypes or perfectionism. It's about gender equality, embracing individuality, and mutual understanding. This movie isn't exclusively for women; it showcases the fierce presentation of chuunibyou (middle school syndrome) in both genders. Outstanding performances and dance sequences keep the entire film engaging without clich√©s.",1
"I thought the first half of the movie was quite humorous, taking the Mickey out of the whole Barbie phenomenon that it is.",1
"This movie didn't really fit with all the other movies I love like fight club and things like it but I am secretly so connected with it. It really has the power to make me cry and laugh and I just have fun watching it. I truely love Greta and I think she did such an amazing job , so did america , I hope she wins best supporting actress because her monologue was incredible. I have been to watch this movie twice now because I love all the important details. It's so perfected to every last part , the same pink feel to it. It makes you love being a girl and love girlhood. It's a great meaningful movie.",1
I'm a dude so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.,1
I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this. At the very beginning I thought it would be a pointless film of how perfect you should look and how you should act a certain way in order for society to like you.,1
"This movie has fun aesthetics, and fun costumes, and sometimes funny moments, definitely great actors, but the whole ideological feminist spin Greta Gerwig did in the plot ruins the entire thing, honestly, and turns a movie that could have been super fun into a bland and boring one. I thought the whole point in society is for us to be equal, not to condemn either gender or portay either gender as ruling society, like why does the male gender not own houses, why are they portayed as disposable and not taken into account, and it the end, they still don't get houses? Also this is a misrepresentation of the real world, as a woman with a career and decent income, I can tell you I in fact have more privilege than some of my male colleagues. Instead of portaying equality, the movie ends on a note where the male species is dumb and still not on equal footing. Disappointing.",0
"I wouldn't call it a good movie, but certainly enjoyable and funny!",1
"So hilarious and intelligently written. The writers sincerely can't be credited enough with how smart and funny this movie is. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and find new jokes, there's just so many! If you're uptight about the way many women feel how they ""fit into"" society, then this movie may not be for you. But, you're missing out. I hope the academy finally starts recognizing comedies. It's so much more difficult to write something funny and be an actor that can pull of true comedy than drama. It just is. You have to be new, creative and intelligent. Dramas, you can just play things that people automatically get emotional about, It's so hard to figure out what many will find funny, yet alone hilarious. The Academy should nominate Gosling (sp?) for best actor, Robbie for best actress, the move for best screen play and movie. It was just so creative and funny. Loved it, and honestly, I thought I'd hate it.",1
"Its allright , but its a fresh idea and worth the hype. The story line is a little boring, the musics and dancing are excellent ! This is the definition of Gen Z movie , very up to date and very relatable to this generation. Very Easy to understand , you'll need a coffee to keep you wide awake if you're very critical to the movies . Ryan Gosling is absolutely a bait to the movie . There's part of the movie that i think is not necessary and not friendly to the underage audience , absolutely need parental guidance. Once again overall to me it's ok movie . Worth the oscar ? Yes ! , best picture ? NAH .",1
I never cared for Barbie but the movie is really good I think the casting is perfect and the music and who they got to do the soundtrack I also love how they made the Barbie world a separate land and it was brighter then the whole world and I love how they went to the Mattel head quarters and the people trying to take her away and Barbie and Ken being in the real In the real world also the marketing team did amazing on the promo and advertisement on the movie with all the company's collab with Barbie and etc so overall the Barbie movie got a lot of hype and well deserved excellent film and amazing for people who love barbie.,1
"This movie is the definition of camp and fun cinema that also makes you think. I don't think I've ever laughed as much and for so long as I did when I was in the theater watching this movie. This movie is one of them where before you've even finished watching it the first time around you know you are gonna be coming back to watch it again and again. I remember watching all of the trailers and teasers and being so excited for this movie but also scared, because this could have either be the greatest movie ever or the worst movie ever. And of course it was the greatest movie ever. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to just have fun and laugh for the 2-hour run time (that flew by super quick).",1
"It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.",1
"If you're making brand films, each of his directors reveals his own vision, and that vision generally lacks some points. However, I think Greta Gerwig knew all aspects of Barbie so well that she reflected it on the screen perfectly. Margot Robbie also played the part very well apart from a few small scenes. In fact, when Barbie is mentioned, the role is well-accepted. Of course, Barbie is not the only character fully reflected in the movie. By writing Ken as a one-dimensional character and inserting a prominent role in the story, he significantly increased the directors of the movie games. Ryan Gosling had a great acting. Frankly, he manages to steal the heart of television in every scene on the screen. For the other Barbie and Ken players, the states didn't show much of a performance (Maybe Kate McKinnon). There were no such important scenes anyway. But America Ferrera didn't do a great job despite having a very available house. I wouldn't say that I played badly, but there are a lot of actors who give better use of that role in my opinion.",1
"This was perfectly cast. I mean Ryan Gosling as Ken (I just can not picture anyone else doing it that well). Margot Robbie is absolute perfection and Michael Cera's ""Allan"" is just hilarious. Not to mention the rest of the cast. It was surprisingly very touching, poignant, and extremely nostalgic. I mean they got everything perfect. Every touch of the playhouses, the outfits. I loved that the entire audience went dressed in pink. The little girl in me was *screaming*. Loved every single part of it. The Kens revolution and dance sequence are just so creative. I would watch this over and over. So thoughtful.",1
"I think Greta Gerwig perfectly threaded the needle between astute social commentary on Barbie, and a love letter to the doll that shaped America. It is a campy oasis in the midst of an industry that seems to increasingly worship somber realism. It has all the charm of an 80s cult classic, on a 2023 budget. Alongside hilarious writing that made my cheeks hurt by the end, is incredible set and costume design, and standout acting performances from a remarkably cohesive cast. There are also subtle details I really appreciated like Barbie's car being a 1959 corvette, the same year the doll was released. I'll knock one star off because in a few moments towards the end, the plot gets lost in itself, and it feels like they are speaking in riddles.",1
"""Barbie: So Clever and Colourfully Fantastic!"" is a cinematic masterpiece, gracefully dancing between hilarity and heartfelt emotion. This modern gem captivates with fantastic acting and a vibrant kaleidoscope of colors, embracing the theme of being ordinary and finding one's true self in a world that often celebrates the extraordinary. Refreshingly, it focuses on genuine connections, friendships, and personal growth instead of romance, making it enchanting without clich√©s. The talented cast delivers outstanding performances, while the visuals and captivating dance sequences create moments of pure cinematic magic. ""Barbie"" strikes the perfect balance between humour and gravitas, making it a touching and relatable exploration of self-discovery. A delightful fusion of ""Elf"" and ""Pinocchio,"" it charms audiences worldwide, transcending age and background. For an uplifting and soulful movie experience, ""Barbie"" is the perfect cinematic gem.",1
"I have never seen a Barbie movie. My wife loves them and so I have heard some of the songs, but I have never actually watched one. Having seen some videos and commercials and things, I had a vague sense of what it was about.",1
"I absolutely adored this movie, without spoilers I can say it's truly fun and surprisingly a lot deeper than you would initially think going into it. Beyond that I thought the cinematography was fantastic and the color palette was perfect, and above all else the acting was amazing from everyone in it! Especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, I know people were hesitant to accept him as Ken but he really knocks it out of the park, and I honestly cannot believe they considered people other than Margot Robbie to be Barbie. It's like she was BORN for this role. Absolutely adored this movie and I hope no one listens to the review bombing, it really is a treat!!",1
"I personally expected the movie to be fun and adventurous. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem.",1
I completely enjoyed Greta Gerwig's outstanding movie Barbie. It was delightful to see on the big screen with the great soundtrack and the eye-popping colors. Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie and she made a great movie even better.,1
"Barbie was a very fun, light-hearted, over-the-top movie that takes you on a wild journey. The fact that it paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey's opening sequence earned it extra points for me! Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast, and the production design was fantastic. A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy, and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny! I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines. This may get some backlash, but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today, and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today. I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom. Just because a movie talks about issues you care about, however important they may be, doesn't mean it's the ""greatest movie of all time"" and ""Oscar-worthy"" etc. The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me, how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause. But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didn't give the creative plot idea enough justice. Movies don't have to be so explicit with the social commentary, as shown by movies like 12 Angry Men (1957), which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today. At certain times, Barbie really blurred the line between being anti-patriarchy and being anti-men. It felt like it was fighting injustice with more injustice, although not throughout.",1
"I have seen this film in theaters twice now and I can safely say that I thought it was amusing, entertaining, and fun. However, I won't lie to you and say that it's really all that groundbreaking as some seem to claim. While this movie focuses on heavy topics such as inequality and feminism, some of the scenes that had primarily concentrated on them had felt a little shallow. I am not saying that this wasn't a great film, as said before, it delivered most if not all of the checkpoints that modern day society defines a ""good movie"" with. Now I can't say that I wasn't entertained mostly through the movie but it just lacked something. The longer this film had stuck with me the longer it felt insufficient. People that are currently speaking on this movie seem to pin up its success in presenting femininity and women's issues in a lighthearted and joyful manner, however I feel that the overall message in this movie could have been provided in a more severe tone. The creators of Barbie stated that this was an ""everyone movie"", that this film was designed to cater to all viewers, but did it have to? The laughable tone this movie brought along with its own narrative of modern day feminism sort of cheapened the message. Don't get me wrong, all the acting in the movie was phenomenal for the roles each actor portrayed, but it felt like some of the plot had gotten lost in translation. Even after watching the movie twice I still am a little fuzzy on the entirety of ""Barbieland"". Where is this really set?, why it is a common occurrence of dolls making their way into the real world?, why do barbies know they're toys? I might just be inattentive but these plot point were rarely touched on through the film and still leave me confused. Overall I think my main issue with this film is my regrettable rating, I really didn't want this movie to be below a 9. I was really looking forward to this film and eagerly waiting to ""do anything to see it in theaters again"", but it turned out to be just ok. A word I can describe my expectations for this movie is iconic, but it just fell flat in that department. Would I recommend? Yeah why not, but would I jump at the opportunity to see it again ever? Probably not.",1
"This is a weirdly complicated film. I wish I could say that was meant to be a compliment, but I found myself trying to figure out where all the pieces fit as the story unraveled.",1
"I continuously laughed and cried the whole movie. The acting is impeccable. There are so many small details and visual gags that I'm sure there were things I missed because I was laughing so much. It's clear the writers are intimately familiar with doll play, and how Barbies are actually used by children.",1
"Barbie is enjoyable, thats for sure, but it brings some problems such as the films plot, which is all over the place, and goes in a lot of unlikable directions at times. However, this doesn't bring the film down, as there are enjoyable and smart aspects of the film that climb the hurdles to make Barbie an enjoyable summer watch that caters for all ages!",1
"This film offers an exhilarating journey, weaving a tapestry of thrills and suspense that captivates from the opening scene. The meticulously crafted plot, enriched by stellar performances, maintains an unrelenting pace, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats. Visually striking, each frame contributes to the overall intensity, whether through heart-pounding action sequences or subtle psychological tension. It's a cinematic experience that transcends the ordinary, immersing viewers in a world where every moment is charged with anticipation. Special effects seamlessly integrate into the narrative, heightening the film's impact.",1
"Barbie was so fun! I think some scenes were a bit hard to follow but I think that's a fun play on how girls play with dolls. I laughed a lot and felt a bit moved and touched. I wasn't really sure what to expect but it was fun to watch all the way through! I loved all of the vintage Barbie pieces and references to the many versions of the doll as well. The scenery was amazing, I think Barbie land gave off a technicolor vibe which was amazing. The scene I loved the most was when Barbie comments on how beautiful the old lady was and the older woman says she knows it! It's a fun film for women of all ages, my grandmother, mother, sisters and friends could all relate to this film! A true masterpiece on girlhood and womanhood.",1
Barbie movie was very under my expectations.,0
Gets you a typical Hollywood movie which feels good to watch but provokes you to think it helps you decide whether you want to be just influenced by the world around you the media the news and the industry which is grabbing your attention or do you want to accept that you are a human being with needs and wants and not just a piece of toy to be manipulated by the media.,1
"First of all, please can we all hail Ryan Gosling for the stellar performance of Beach Ken. I had reservations as he is older than I would have picked for that role but hot damn does he give it his all and it pays off. Genuinely Oscar worthy stuff. Also can we also all appreciate how good the song ""I'm Just Ken"" is!",1
"I went into Wednesday expecting to write things like ""the greatest weekend in cinema"", ""Oppenheimer brings cinema to the screen again"", ""Barbie wins the weekend""... But this is so much more than that.",1
"This movie had so much potential!! It was doing so well for a while, it was funny and clever and had depth and I was super excited to see where it was going to go, but then it just became disappointing with a really underwhelming and incoherent (even problematic) conclusion. I'm almost angry at it. Even pure shallow entertainment would have been better than planting all these seeds, making you believe they will grow into something and then just letting them die.",0
Got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.,1
"Acting is good, Margot did an amazing job at portraying Barbie even though Ryan as Ken absolutely stole the show to be honest. Humour wasn't amazing but it was still good enough to make me laugh a few times. Plot is slightly messy, not horrible, like I get it but the movie didn't really dive into anything too deep either in my opinion but at least it does mention some important subjects. Another thing that bothered me was the waste of Will Ferrell's character who could have been a better ""villain"" that simply an incapable clown. I still very much enjoyed this movie and think the movie still works because it's execution, cool idea and good acting but needed a bit more complexity and maybe a better written villain with actual motives in order to become a ""masterpiece"".",1
"The duality of being perfect and yet still not being enough is portrayed so well here. This movie is about being able to relate to the constant evolution of the human condition, specifically in a way that centers growing up from being a naive child to being aware of yourself and the judgement of others. This movie does center women, but any individual claiming this movie is a misandrist anthem has no idea of even a notion to what the point of this movie was.",1
This is.... Was.... Admirably!,1
"Greta Gerwig has had a hit or miss career. Her film Little Women was fairly entertaining, but I found her film Lady Bird to be completely obnoxious. Same goes for Margot Robbie. I enjoyed her in Wolf Of Wall Street and Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, but really disliked I Tonya and Birds of Prey.",0
"Greta Gerwig, took the most famous doll of humanity, a luxury cast and made a good film with an important message!",1
"The comedy was ok at times. Otherwise, this movie has a modern political agenda, and this is probably one of the reasons why it is highly rated. I understand the need for awareness of women's rights, possibilities, and freedom. It's here even in the 21st century, especially in some countries. However, I'm not sure if movies like this could succeed in giving the good message, or make it even worse, as sometimes the movie is disgustingly misandrous. Not to say that the overall experience of the content was not like a movie, but more of a parody of a movie. I love Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but this piece is definitely overrated.",0
"I was so excited to see this movie for months, even buying some of the merch and promotional products for it, but it turned out to be such a huge letdown. I was expecting it to be a fun, light-hearted, nostalgic movie similar to how the Super Mario movie was, but I left the theater pretty disappointed with Barbie. It does start off cute, but about halfway through the movie it gets very heavy handed with politics, and becomes a complete battle of the sexes. This lasts all the way until the end of the movie. The political messaging starts to become like beating a dead horse by the time the movie is over. What I thought was going to be a fun, relaxing night at the movies turned into what seemed like a political debate. Such a disappointment! I feel like there was so much potential for this to be such a great, fun movie, it really is a shame how it was turned into a battle of the sexes, women are perfect and can do no wrong while men are complete losers showdown. I am a woman myself, and all that political messaging in the movie was so unnecessary. It would have been completely fine to keep the messaging at how girls can grow up to do whatever career they want and they don't have to look a certain way to be beautiful, etc., but this movie was just too over the top with the messaging of women are perfect, women are better than men, etc. It was just all so unnecessary. I did give it a few points because there were a few funny parts in it, and the set was beautiful, but neither of those things could make up for how disappointing it turned out to be.",0
"So the other day (as of me writing this atleast), I watched the 2023 Barbie Movie made by Warner Bros. Going in, I was expecting it to be fun and maybe a little bit meta, but I was not expecting how meta this movie was going to be. Let me explain.",1
"So good, the emotions, the reality and how it came together as a live action BARBIE film was perfect and outstanding which is good for adults as well as children. I am so impressed how well this was pulled off and the details from the outfits to the design of the sets was outstanding. There was laughing and crying in this film and which relates to everyday life and having all the different barbies was brilliant! My favourite has to be the weird BARBIE because I definitely relate to her more! I recommend watching this and giving it a go because you may think oh it's just a kids film but once you've watched it, it's not what you expect and I'm itchy to watch it again!",1
"I saw Barbie yesterday with four women friends. We didn't know what to expect, but we all loved the movie! The writing was amazing. The acting was perfect. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were a great team. The music and dancing was truly entertaining. I actually cared about the characters, all the Barbies, all the Kens, as well as the mother and daughter in the ""real"" world. Will Ferrell was at his peak comedically. I also appreciated the overlay of politics, for those who are so inclined. I plan to see it again. I think more men should see it, as it treats men with compassion, humor and hope.",1
"Just amazing and a spectacular film for everyone of all ages. The cast and direction of the film were amazing! The set pieces and art direction was inspired. Additionally, the script was air tight and very funny. I cried and laughed throughout the film. I truly believe the movie will become a classic. The only reason it lost a star was because of some of the loose ends of the plot in the film. Overall the film was a great movie going event and extremely rewarding. I think Gerwig is very good at subverting audience expectations which makes the film more engaging. I would recommend this movie for everyone.",1
"1 point lost for the storyline, it lacked a clear/meaningful plot that the viewer can use to surmise the movie at the end.",0
I enjoyed this film very much even if I didn't learn anything new - because I'm old enough. But I would love it if I gad some movie like this to watch during my teenage days.,1
"I feel like we as a society can't move past our parents and grandparents battles... women in first world civilizations have it better than ever (spoiler alert, it'll only get so good). Movie would have had a great message 60 years ago.",1
Wow If this film is spectacular and weird And I loved every single second of it I also think the cast was perfect especially ryan gosling Marga robbie If you want a film Makes you feel everything that has to do with happy I highly recommend this film I Also the Is over all message of the film Was pretty positive and great And no humans Are definitely not perfect And I just think that's the Positive message anyone could say in a film I definitely hope this film gets a sequel And I also think that it was very clever the way they Is made this Is film self aware And even the greater appeared herself Highly recommended.,1
"After having seen Oppenheimer (also reviewed) in 35MM and IMAX 70MM, I decided it was time to view the other half of Barbenheimer. With my local cinema usually being quiet, and the film having been out for weeks, I was happy to find that the screening of Barbie was almost sold out when I got one of the few tickets left, leading to me entering Barbie's world.",1
I always knew Barbie was going to be hit and miss. The reality was the acting was spot on and I'll give it 3 stars purely on the basis that it had some good humour points.,0
"Barbie, Barbie, Barbie, Barbie!? So disappointed in this film. I believed all the hype, and the boffo box office. People must be hard up for light-hearted fun, and too bad that Barbie didn't serve that up. Unfortunately, it was less of a movie and more of a two-hour Mattel commercial. And the movie delves into heavy-handed politics that other (serious) films have done much better. Serving up feminism, hyper-masculinity, misogyny and BEACHING you over the head with it was not only disappointing but was it misleading and misappropriated. It wasn't the movie I wanted to see, but it did have some bright moments especially with Kate McKinnon and Ariana Greenblatt. The weirdness factor was on a scale of 10, and I can only rate the movie at a 5 stars, but I do give Ryan Gosling's chest a 10...it was the only constant in the film, along with the prettiness of Margot Robbie.",0
"After years and years of development and casting changes, the live action Barbie movie is finally out for the whole world to see. Co-written and directed by actor turned filmmaker Greta Gerwig and co-produced by and starring Margot Robbie as the titular doll, the film has proven to be one of the most anticipated summer blockbusters of 2023 and a welcome anniversary present to Warner Bros' 100th year since their inception. Now that the film is out for the public and media to enjoy, the best way to describe it is a hysterically subversive commentary on feminism disguised as a cheesy fantasy comedy.",1
"Barbie is a beautifully heart-warming extravaganza for both boys and girls alike. A gloriously pink, joy-filled experience that I can't wait to go and see again. From the wonderful set design and perfect casting to the brilliant soundtrack and story to match, there is something for everyone to enjoy.",1
"In this movie, I cried, laughed, had deep thoughts... I consider myself a big fan of the soundtrack, and i absolutely loved the story, characters, topic etc. I found the touch to feminism extremely reflecting our society, and I recommend this movie for anyone who- anyone, just anyone. This is a movie that will change people's minds and educate children while being a fun movie with an interesting plot! I definitely want to watch it again, since time flew by so quickly while watching this masterpiece, this amazing film that really made me leave the hall in tears. Please, if you haven't already, I recommend you to go watch it immediately.",1
"Finally stepped into the Barbie-verse with my wife and sons. The film is both simple and ambitious, which deftly allowed us to enjoy on a variety of levels. Probably best for you to see this before too long, and before you hear too much (indirectly or incorrectly) about the film imho.",1
"I saw this movie opening night and my expectations were beyond met and exceeded the limitations of what I thought a good movie was. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I was moved completely and entirely. I laughed, I cried, and I left the movie changed. It is a masterpiece. For those who don't understand, I highly recommend watching the movie again. The writing, the characters, the set, and the outfits were so brilliantly curated. I do not even hesitate to say it is now one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies I have EVER seen. Greta Gerwig is nothing less than a genius and deserves ALL of the recognition. The casting was perfection. The meaning behind the movie holds a special place in my heart and EVERY SINGLE PERSON NEEDS to see this movie. My favorite part of the movie was not ONLY the movie itself but the effect it is having on the communities surrounding it. The collective unspoken rule of dressing up to go see this movie. Brilliant.",1
"I'm a huge fan of Barbie, so when I heard there was a movie coming out, I was beyond excited & I certainly wasn't disappointed when I got to see it!",1
"This fulfills my childhood in a way I could never have anticipated. It reflects upon the flaws of our world and helps us all accept them by also accepting the imperfections in ourselves, like the fact that we are all a little dark and weird and crazy sometimes. And that doesn't make us any less men or women, or whater we are or want to be.",1
"I was not expecting this movie to be great; I'm not into this kind of stuff, but still, I watched it, and man, it was great; some scenes are relatable to how people react to something nowadays, like, come on, everything and everyone can be cancelled, the overall acting of the cast is super great. I love it; almost all the song are catchy and complements the movie (like this song, by the way (Im just Ken)); the production set for this film is majestic, and parts of the movie are touching and somewhat relatable to our everyday life, and there can be something to learn from, very recommended to watch this with your whole family and friends.",1
"Barbie wasn't supposed to be that deep but it was. Greta Gerwig must have wielded a pen that ignites to write this story down with so much boldness, creativity, and awareness that no one could ever imagine for an already perfect plastic to deserve.",1
"Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway.",1
"I don't understand all the hype around this movie. I found it boring, with almost no plot. It had a few fun moments, nothing too funny, I don't think I ever laughed throughout the whole movie. A great performance from Ryan Gosling indeed, although Margot Robbie was perhaps mediocre. He definitely stole the thunder. Regarding patriarchy and feminism, it merely scratched the surface of those terms. It was perhaps more of a simulation of how an elementary teacher would explain patriarchy to kids. It doesn't offer anything to adults, except for if they lived in a cave and never heard about patriarchy.",0
"I was excited to see this movie after hearing how much people liked it. I anticipated it having strong messages and it did, but it was a little all over the place. I'm not sure there actually was a cohesive message, but I found myself very emotional at moments during this film. I think it speaks to both men and women who feel societal pressures to be certain things and act certain ways. The music is amazing, and the Ken dance sequence might have been my favorite thing I have seen at the movies this year. This movie is also hilarious throughout. I left not knowing exactly how I was meant to feel, but I did enjoy all the pieces even if they didn't come together completely.",1
"I wasn't expecting much, but this movie is great! It's a smart comedy. The film is clearly feminist, but it is NOT ""preachy"" as some other reviewer complained. Yes, there is one speech, but it's not made by a Barbie. It fits into the story.",1
"Oppression is a state of mind, even when objectively you are oppressed.",0
"First, the good bits. I thoroughly enjoyed the cast, even got to see some favorites in semi-major roles. For a blockbuster movie like this, good acting is to be expected. I also, as many fellow viewers pointed out, enjoyed the intricacies that made the movie seem like it was scripted by a kid. That was the whole point with the floating and dramatics-things that can only happen in imagination actually happen in the movie.",1
"Was walking into this movie expecting a light-harder fun movie about Barbie and Ken, but left questioning the systemic inequality in our society. What many men will tell you is that this movie is just another woke feminist movie, but I highly encourage everyone to go watch Barbie to truly understand how women feel in todays world. Furthermore the production of the movie was greath. Everything from the cast, the plot, the pacing, the acting, the cinematography and ending was well done. I already know this movie is gonna cause lots of polarisation, but I would recommend everyone to watch this movie and come to their own conclusions.",1
"Barbie, with a surprising amount of political undertones, will probably be one of the most surprising releases of 2023.",1
"No movie I've seen lately has made me feel this happy. I went to the theater thinking I was going to see an ordinary romantic comedy, but as I watched the movie I started to think about what popular culture has done to people. The costumes are exquisite. The location designs are incredible. Makeup and jewelry design is perfect. And the acting is so natural that it draws you into the movie. A movie for the summer months. You feel incredibly happy when you leave the movie and go home. You are in a fairy tale world but you are facing the harshest realities of the world. I thank everyone who contributed. I hope that the interest in the movie will not lead to a repeat of the mistakes that have been made many times before and a second Barbie movie will not be made.",1
"I say this without a shred of irony; Greta Gerwig's Barbie is undoubtedly the film we so desperately need right now. This is the movie of our time - a film that shows us what life and society are like now, as well as shows us how we can do better. Plus, the movie is pure joy! It's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.",1
"Wow!!! Barbie really brought my attention in the cinemas! It made me laugh and cry at the same time. I was literally enjoying the best moments in the film, and it really is a beautiful movie, and Barbie was made for kids, but there are also not meant for kids.",1
"More could you want from a movie? How about Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, and Hari Nef all playing Barbie variations, like Weird Barbie, President Barbie, and Doctor Barbie. Plus, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, and Ncuti Gatwa are all playing Kens. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the company who first brought us Barbie and her Dreamhouse. The film focuses on what happens when the perfect doll has an existential crisis, and Mattel's pursuit to stop Barbie from changing the real world forever. Greta Gerwig ('Lady Bird') directs a script she co-wrote with partner and fellow filmmaker Noah Baumbach ('Marriage Story'). Drop by the Dreamhouse in your pink convertible when the movie premieres in July 2023.",1
"Barbie is simply a mind-blowing experience, and in a truly fine way! I was taken aback with the 2001 opening, since I have a personal aversion to seeing toys get destroyed, but then it starts to unfold.",1
"The film in question bears a striking resemblance to the gender dynamics often seen in 1950s-era movies, with a notable twist-the roles are reversed. In this narrative, men find themselves depicted as hapless losers, overlooked and disregarded, while women are idealized as flawless beings.",0
Barbie was such a delight and a surprise favorite of mine. Going into this film I didn't have high expectations because I didn't think it was going to be for me. I was completely wrong! Barbie is a very well crafted and enjoyable film. The movie has a lot of heart and soul with also having funny moments. Margot Robbie was a perfect casting decision for this movie and Director Greta Gerwig knows exactly what type a film she was making. The movie is very colorful when they are showing Barbie world and then it switches to a more dull/realistic color when in the real world. Ryan Gosling as Ken was another perfect casting choice and I feel brought his A game when it came to comedic segments. You don't have to be into the Barbie dolls to enjoy this film. I will say this movie is more geared toward adults rather then young people because of the themes they deal with. You will know what I'm talking about when you see the film. Barbie will stand the test of time and I'm sure will be a classic a few years from now. Barbie gets a near perfect 9 stars out of 10 from me.,1
Its very rare for me to see cheap made movies but after so long this is it. Barbie is nothing but a cheap boring project. I do not get any of the hype for a cheaply made movie like this. This brings nothing good to the table. It is a waste of time and money to see this movie. Its very obvious to tell what movie is cheaply made and that has no effort put into it.,0
"The Barbie movie was a fun movie that lacked a little bit in plot, but was overall a hilarious movie to watch. While many people out there seem to hate this movie for empowering women and taking down men, they are looking at it the wrong way, they movie gave an in depth tour into all the common stereotypes set on women and men and intensified them to show their true meanings and how people can become affected by them, all while keeping the Barbie theme at the heart of the plot. It addressed and took down many of the common stereotypes and truly exposed the reality of society for what it really is, a patriarchy, which isn't necessarily a bad thing however the movie is sure to make clear that women should and can have a more equal presence in ""powerful"" positions in society.",1
"I went to this movie without watching previews or expecting anything. This movie turned out to be everything a Barbie-loving thirty-something needed twenty years ago. Expertly cast, the Barbie movie is hilariously self-aware and has no dull moments. Though the Micheal is obviously mainly about Barbie, Ken has his own moment to shine that ends up being the subplot.",1
"Barbie is an amazing film that mixes comedy and emotional moments skilfully. All the performances are perfect, except for Ryan Gosling who was exceptional at playing himself. I will cry if it doesn't win an Oscar, if not for I'm Just Ken it should be for the phenomenal set design. The costume department really worked their socks off as every character feels unique in its style yet cohesive. The writing was very well thought out and barely gives you a second to catch your breath. Now the star of the show Margot Robbie. I could have wrote a whole review just on her performance. Although we all know her as a very talented actress, she was definitely built for this role. Michael Cera made a great comeback with this role, and was mine and many others favourite part of the film. Also shoutout to Rob Brydon as Sugardaddy Ken!",1
"I love that this film incorporates comedy and realism into it. I also like the fact that it wasn't entirely about Barbie and woman, but also about men and that they also have feelings and emotions. As a 15 year old girl, this made me think about what its like from my mother perspective in life, and that no matter, what they will always support us in what we want to be or dream to be. Coming out of the theatre, a whirlwind of emotions flooded my mind. Glorias speech made me realise that even though the world and people demand us to be perfect doesn't mean we have to achieve those demands, we need to find ourselves and love ourselves before we love anyone or let anyone love us. I understand that men feel as though Ken deserved a bit of leadership ad power, but the Barbies built that land. Us woman love this movie because it opens up our imagination of what we can be, and though people says "" Oh, they could've let the Ken's have a bit of ownership and power"" But when Barbie went to the real world, you could see from most women's perspective of what their life is like on a daily basis 'not saying all men are like this stereotype'. Barbieland gives young girls the motivation and the idea that they CAN be a president, a construction worker, an astronaut, an they can be weird. I understand that people hav their different opinions, and this is just mine.",1
"Words cannot express how happy I am that the high expectations I had due to the hype were more than fulfilled. The story is beautiful, the execution makes it brilliant. I really felt the joy and energy that everyone put in to make this possible. Margot makes a perfect Barbie, but Ryan's Ken is just perfection. I really hope they will get showered with awards and recognition!",1
"Just watched the premi√®re of Barbie with my wife, my daughter and my son. I'm pleasantly surprised. Sure, it's a fun movie and Margot Robbie is gorgeous as Barbie (and Ryan Gosling is a perfect Ken). But the movie is, in fact, an interesting commentary on, both, patriarchy (and the negative effects Barbie dolls have had over the years) as well as on mortality. The movie is more profound than I would have thought. I'm also pleasantly surprised by the open-mindedness and humour of Mattel. What is missing is that the movie sometimes lacks intensity and becomes only candy for the eyes.",1
"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.",1
"I think Barbie has always been about women empowerment and I'm glad there's a Barbie movie that doesn't tiptoe around it to spare feelings. This movie was not marketed towards kids, it was clearly meant for adults who grew up with Barbie. It's an important message and it was told well. The cinematography was also incredible. Loved the costumes, the casting, everything about it. Margot played a literal perfect Barbie. I loved the scene where she was supposed to be ""ugly"" and the narrator made a joke about Margot being the wrong person to cast if you wanted to make an ugly scene with her. Ryan gosling also have an amazing performance as Ken. Even when he was being a douche he still came across lovable.",1
"I loved this movie so much. It's so effortlessly funny with the end being heartfelt and quite sad. The soundtrack is amazing including one of my favorite songs by billie eilish ""what was i made for."" The song is so amazing and finishes off the movie in the best way possible.",1
"I recently had the pleasure of watching ""Barbie,"" a film that captivated me with its charm, vibrant storytelling, and imaginative scenes. As a fan of movies that blend fantasy with a touch of reality, I found ""Barbie"" to be a delightful escape into a world filled with color, adventure, and heart.",1
80%. The Barbie film genuinely transforms the examination of the toy's influence on generations of girls and women into its very essence. Gerwig and Baumbach lure viewers with the promise of wholesome pop-culture amusement while subtly introducing a more intricate battle of the sexes.,1
"First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I really liked it and I had high expectations about that movie, because it was very innovative. I have to admit, as a man, I really enjoyed that movie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. The plot of the movie was very interesting, mysterious and really innovative, because there aren't any other movies similar to this one. The storyline was very well written, well-explained and it's concept was definitely something original. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and really likeable. The filming locations of the movie were mainly, barbie land and the real world. The casting was really good and their acting was descent, everyone portrayed their characters really well. The opening scene was definitely unpredictable, very promising and I really liked it. The ending scene was kinda unpredictable and it was hilarious, I definitely enjoyed it. Also, it was a kinda funny movie and there were some intense scenes. Overall, ""Barbie"" was an unexpectedly enjoyable movie, innovative, very meta and it probably deserves a sequel!",1
"I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this. I had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing. The movie works. There is definitely a moral message in this, even though I believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed. I feel like with a different script they could have created something truly great.",1
"Never have I ever experienced this much fun during a movie. Every actor played its part perfectly. With enough self-awerness, humour and silly moments this was everything I hoped for. The budget was also insane, I can't wait to rewatch this so I can look at all the details again. The way Barbie moves, walks, drinks, acts?? Perfection.",1
"This was a great movie for the type that it is. Yes, is cheeky / cheesy/ over the top. It's also heart warming, fun, and really original. I loved the way that the movie hit the nail on the head about the complexity of being female, young or old. It truly was a reflection of how so many of us have been made to feel. They also got some laughs over play on words or specific movements made by the actors and actresses because it was just so real and true to the way we all played as children. The casting of MR as Barbie and RG as Ken were such perfect choices. The kids liked it and so did us 30 somethings. Perfect balance of nostalgia and today. Highly recommend it.",1
"My 20 year old daughter and I loved this movie so much. It was adorable and funny and surprisingly heartwarming. I really think anyone would enjoy this though. It had such a sweet simple message done so colorfully. Perfect casting. Margot Robbie literally is a doll. And Ryan Gosling is a combination of hot and funny. We wore pink of course and saw some cute outfits. A couple Ken shirts. While we were leaving, still teary eyed, seeing the mothers, daughters, friends and sisters all wearing pink, it was so touching and we thought how lucky they were to be able to watch Barbie for the first time. I still feel emotional hours later thinking about it. Highly recommend.",1
"When I first knew there was a Barbie movie in production, a live action, I thought ""It should be as bad as the others movies""...
When I notice was Greta Gerwig making the movie, my expectation get higher. Then, when I saw the cast, my expectations were even higher!",1
"Barbie is not just a stereotypical Hollywood film to celebrate the well-known brand. But it dives in deeper into more self existence, gender equality and journey of life. The messages however are understandably more female centric but still can be enjoyed and appreciated by all, barring the Mattel Company staff scenes and characters that doest not land. They are portrayed unconvincingly with nonchalant writing and takes you out of the film . The third act feels over-bloated that dips the high trajectory gear that the film was on since the start. The actors , Robbie, Gosling & Ferrera are standouts!",1
"Barbie is a movie that you start laughing of the critics that are put in such an intelligent way (you have to think fast between laughs), amazed by the idea of a perfect world and suddenly they start to go in your feelings and bring out so many realizations about yourself with funny dialogs. We never goin to forget what it is see Margot and Ryan such an incredible performance the way them put so many emotions and still keep that doll mindset is brilliant and for Greta all my reverence it's breathtaking think that she decided to go up front with such strong movie and we didn't expect anything different from her. Oscar winners here we go.",1
"While the production value, cinematography and acting were what you would expect from Margo Robbie and the supporting cast. I felt the movie fell short of not preaching to me and spreading a message of division rather than unity. Men and women cannot survive without each other but you'd never know it watching this movie. And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came. After the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda they're trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable. Come to find out my daughter is better suited to take on the world that I thought she was. Proud day for me as a father.",0
"Addresses current critical issues; basically, the movie revolves around that. The central ideas are patriarchy and female empowerment, which I believe were handled intelligently and elegantly. I was particularly surprised in this regard; I didn't expect the film to be so mature.",1
"Barbie was honestly a pleasant surprise, I went as a joke thinking it would be stupid but ended up loving the movie. The acting and humour were perfect and everything was so well done. The storyline was incredibly good for a movie about dolls and I am honestly impressed. The soundtrack was great and the songs sung were even better. The effects and sets were perfect for the theme and plot and it just worked so well. I absolutely loved it and hope it does well at the box office because it deserves so many awards. Margot Robbie, great. Ryan Gosling, amazing. Michael Cera, better than ever. Will ferrel, yes! John Cena, best character. Great movie everyone should watch!!!",1
"Barbie is fantastic from beginning to end. I was hooked in from the beginning of seeing Barbie Land and how it was portrayed. I thought their decision to make it like real dolls from the acting, to the production and set design was perfect, creative, and clever. It was also a little bit unexpected and surprising. Loved all of that. The script is great as a whole as well. Greta and Noah Baumbach wrote, I think a really intriguing story here. Greta's direction is also excellent. Also the cast all nails it here. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling especially. The soundtrack was great as well and fit perfectly. Everything with this I feel just fit pretty seamlessly together and it delivered in the end. What an accomplishment for Greta Gerwig and everyone involved, to make a Barbie movie as great and successful as this.",1
"I saw this movie the other night and had a phenomenal experience. However, I've needed to sit on it for a little while because there were certain elements that I wasn't sure how to feel about. First, Ken. The character himself was hilarious and Ryan Gosling did an outstanding job doing him justice. I loved how his plot discussed radicalization into patriarchal thinking, (like, the guy just wanted to learn about horses! But pipelines into misogyny are literally everywhere, so Ken, being naive, just falls into it), as well as the societal expectation of *needing* to be in a romantic relationship to a codependent extent, leading into incel ideology.",1
Walked out during intermission.,0
"In spite of the crying child in the movie theater, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I did not know what to expect going in. I was pleasantly surprised and found myself giggling at each unexpected turn of the story. It was hilarious watching Ken become infatuated with the patriarchy and then quickly shifting to find Barbie coming to terms with the pains of reality kept me on my toes. And these two competing outlooks found a beautiful synthesis at the end. Funny. Heartwarming. I learned more about Barbie than I ever thought I would. I didn't even know about all the different outfits you could buy for your Barbie. And I am now aware of the existence of Mattel. Hopefully whoever runs their company is doing a better job than Will Ferrell.",1
"Context: I'm a single, straight, childless, 40+ yo dude who rides motorcycles, does kickboxing, and drinks my whisky neat. So I'm probably not what you would think is the target audience, which is why I went in with a ""let's see what the fuss is all about"" attitude more than genuine interest. What a surprise! They made it very fun and entertaining and I truly laughed out loud at a few jokes. I also really appreciated the message, though a bit on the nose at times. While the plot, directing, and production value are good, it really is the cast that is selling this movie and I applaud all of them, supporting characters included. A bit surprisingly, my only word of warning: I would probably not let younger children watch it as some jokes and overall storyline might not be for them.",1
"I don't agree with the other reviews calling this movie a mess and complaining about the poor marketing. Margot herself said this isn't a kids movie. The PG-13 rating should have been a dead giveaway. With that being said, I did watch it with my 8 year old and we both loved the movie so much she wants to watch it again. The adult jokes went right over her head and she didn't even question them.",1
"I was positively surprise. I never write reviews, but I loved the movie. Was funny, the acting was amazing and it kept me so entertained ! Thank you Barbie! I really recommend everyone to watch it, I am happy I did.",1
"At the beginning of the film, Barbieworld is run by women (Barbies), which reflects the real life Barbie dolls that have all sorts of jobs like doctor, scientist, etc.",1
"This movie is specially for those who loves the character of barbie specially in childhood. This film is a treat for Barbie lovers because the way director has told the storyline by introducing a whole barbie world and their characters is interesting to watch. Specially MARGOT ROBBIE what and actress she is her looks, style, acting performances, dresses of barbie all are top notch. Margot Robbie is perfectly suited for this role because she is the only one carrying the whole movie throughout the end. From start to end the main highlight of the this film is Margot Robbie. I've only watched this film for her and she has proved that currently she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. When I talk about supporting cast RYAN GOSLING is the only one who has done justice to the character of Ken rest are just average. Story is the main disappointment of the film, Film starts on a good note with laughs and riot of chaos when Barbie enters into the real world but after a bit of time story get exaggerated and only focuses on the central character which is the drawback of the film and from that case movie doesn't get the chance to give space to the other important characters. Background score and songs are good that wil give you a fresh vibe while watching this film. All n all this movie is a treat for Barbie fans and rest of the audience may consider as an average content....",1
The most basic touchstone for a movie that I can think of is -- is this worth seeing again? For Barbie the answer is yes. There is so much going on in the background of every scene and such incredible detail and craftmanship. I can imagine Oscars coming for set design or costuming or those kinds of awards.,1
"After watching the trailers, promotional materials and interviews I had very high hopes for this film, especially when looking at Greta's other work. I was not disappointed.",1
"This review will sorta just be a barebones review. There's no spoilers because this movie doesn't really have a plot or resolution that can be spoiled. The movie starts out with a reference from 2001: a space odyssey, Which im sure went right over the target audiences heads. Then breaks into a lot of corny jokes in Barbieland. Barbieland is the best part of the movie, the Barbies performances are all hammed up, kind of like a long progressive commercial. But the acting is supposed to be corny and overacted because they're barbies so I'll accept it. Barbieland has a lot of fun moments with the songs and dances and the beach and Cena. The design of Barbieland and costumes of the Barbies and Kens is why this movie is getting this hype ans it definitely lives up to it. Margot Robbie does a good job as barbie and Gosling as Ken is by far the funniest/best part of the movie. Barbie starts her crisis and goes to the real world and everything starts to suck. Ken finding out about patriarchy is the best thing about the real w orld. The jokes in this movie were really weak, the sentimental serious parts are really boring, this movie feels like it's 2 and 1/2 hours and it's only 1h45. Will Ferrell shows up but they forgot to write jokes for him. America Ferrera gives the most genuine performance but her character is devoid of logic and ends up just giving a long lecture. Lots of the corny jokes in this movie fall completely flat, but theres so many jokes in this movie that you will laugh at least a little bit. Men are targeted in this movie and it has no idea what subtlety is, but it is a Barbie movie so i can accept that. And most importantly this movie has no conflict resolution at all, they sorta just end the movie on one last moderately silly joke. This movie was sort of just a forgettable comedy with a lot of hype before it. But hey I'm glad it brought people to theaters again and did have a message worth watching even if it was delivered rather weakly.",1
I've never EVER wrote here on a movie. But now I just had to. Im 31 years old. Grew up with Barbie. So I guess im in the target group.,0
"Attending the prepremiere of the much-anticipated Barbie movie was an experience I won't soon forget, but unfortunately, not for the right reasons. At least 85% of the movie was pure hype, creating high expectations that were ultimately let down.",0
"This is the story of old doll Barbie (since many years ago but presented here as a young beautiful woman). She is suffering a crisis about herself and her existence and wants to go to the real world to have it solved. We see nice images from the real world and the Barbie's world and see several other Barbie doll types all along the movie. This story develops itself by a lot of conflicts mainly because at a certain time her lover Ken betrays her and tries to be the leader of Barbie's world which makes Barbie and her allies to fight him and his followers till the end in several intricate scenes till he is defeated and Barbie becomes a real woman with the help of Ruth, her creator. Not a particularly good movie in terms of story but technically excellent.",1
"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",0
"When you have a cast as big as this film the space for error is low, and although the movie is lots of fun there are still some nitpicks. Lots of the jokes don't land but the ones that do really make you laugh. Margot Robbie gives a great performance and is going to be remembered as barbie for ever. Will Ferrell is very under utilised for such an iconic actor. There's some emotional stuff at the end and that didn't really resonate with me that much, but it might be different for other people. But the best part of this film is Ryan Gosling as Ken let alone all the Kens are great, the musical number and fight they have at the end is the absolute best part of the movie.",1
"This movie is not only lighthearted but a way of exploring how women are seen within society. To Barbie she views herself as someone that strives to be able to do anything a man could do and to her she thought that mirrored to the real world. The movie fights against the double standards women have themselves and about understanding yourself as an individual. To me, the most touching part was the end when it shows clips of women just laughing and enjoying themselves and I felt it had such a deep message to be proud that I am a woman. It also referenced how just because toy Ken is an accessory to Barbie that doesn't have to be his only personality trait which I believed showed a great way of presenting the film was not only about women's explorations and feelings but men's as well.",1
"This movie was a lot of fun to watch. Everybody focuses on Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who were obviously great), but I think America Ferrera and Will Ferrell also gave solid performances.",1
"I went to this movie just to see the eye candy of beautiful people and fanciful sets because, come on, who is more perfectly beautiful to portray Barbie than Margot Robbie? And who's more attractive to be Ken other than Ryan Gosling?",1
"I was VERY excited to see Barbie and I expected SO much. I feel like I got more of the unexpected, and less of what I expected, though I don't really know what I expected.",1
"How did I go to watch Barbie, only to have seen a mildly depressing unecessarily deep movie saturated with politics and talk of mental health. The plot made no sense.",0
"Even though I'm not the target audience for this movie, I thought Barbie might impress me due to Greta Gerwig's previous works but I'm disappointed.",1
"I finally plucked up the courage and wore my usual all black clothes as I braved the hordes of pink wearing women to watch Barbie the latest release from director Great Gerwig. The film opens with a voice over from Helen Mirren telling us how Barbie changed the doll business, no longer did young girls just have dolls that were encouraging them to stay in the kitchen now they had barbie who could have any career with the change of an outfit. Straight away this should tell you about the gender politics of this film but more on that later. We then cut to Barbieland where everything is plastic and fantastic that is until one day Barbie out loud says do you ever think about death? (Is there not a therapist barbie?). From there starts an adventure where Barbie and Ken travel to the real world, barbie in search of her owner to find the source of her new found depressive thoughts and Ken well in search of Barbies heart.",1
"I had high expectations as a result of the media press, however these we're crushed from the start.",0
"Barbie was certainly unique. It has a simple plot which well fits its target youth audience, it does have moments of comedy but don't expect any other sorts of genres. Both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie give a good performance which is convincing at times but not always. Greta Gerwig sometimes shows reasonably interesting and unique cinematography however most of the shots and music are predictable. This movie was packed with a star studded cast which lives it up to a greater name than it deserves. If you have young children they will certainly enjoy it, but if not I wouldn't recommend it to you.",1
I saw this movie with my wife and daughter today and all of us agreed this was a fantastic movie. There were very progressive messages for children. I love the 2001 space odyssey intro.,1
"Wow, this was really bad. Here is the truth. It's boring. Plus, who wants to here about the patriarchy for 2hrs. Yes, the word patriarchy is said like 100 times. It's crazy. This was so heavy handed I don't even get why woman would like it....ithis should be fun, not some political statement. Let me tell you, the only fun was in the first 30 mins. Nobody, and I mean Nobody was laughing. The plot is all over the place and kind of surprising from the actual writer, which has done some great work in the past. Just makes me wonder if she was forced to push all this political stuff by corporate or she actually believes this nonsense. I thought Barbie would just be a fun goofy movie. But to be preached for 2 hours????? What the hell. I'm telling you most people will not like this movie, unless you're far far left.",0
"I've just taken 2 nieces, 9 and 14, to see Barbie. They both hated it... really, really hated it!! And, me: I'm just stunned. I've no idea what I've just seen.",0
This was the Barbie movie I hoped for. First adverts made it appear like Barbie would be sexualized.,1
"I truly hate living in the year of our lord 2023 because my first thought getting out of the theater tonight ended up being: ""THIS is what all the loser right-wing grifters were losing their minds over?"" But I also like living in this time because we get to experience bold, creative films like Greta Gerwig's Barbie.",1
"I can honestly say that ""Barbie"" is one of those movies where you either completely love it or hate it. Either way, there seems to be very little gray matter - and it's the type of film where you simply sit back and enjoy the ride. As a former Barbie connoisseur now in her 40's, I was curious how producers would carry this film. And since nothing is completely original now, I couldn't ignore the overtones similar to 1998's Pleasantville - with our female protagonist postulating the human world outside of ""Barbieland"". Alas, toward the third act, the movie seemed to whip into a full-fledged ""Mama Mia"" production and I wondered amusingly what the hell I was watching at times. There were parts that were downright silly (Ryan Gosling's performance as Ken was hilarious, but borderline over-the-top, to say the least). However, the profound messages of diversity, female empowerment, personal acceptance and loving thyself were ubiquitous (I mean, they REALLY stressed it from start to finish), and little girls across the globe should find the movie worthy of embracing. For us middle-aged moms, you'll delight in several heartfelt chuckles...not to mention the wonderful tie-ins to discontinued Barbies from our past. But once the credits role, you'll also realize one viewing is enough.",1
"Barbie, the movie is great! It stars Margot Robbie as the character Barbie! There's also some so many starring actors/actresses who are also in that movie who they are fictitious! This movie is great for all viewers to watch, including millions people across the nation worldwide! The movie is a comedy, live action, and funny! Margot Robbie is an inspiring actress known for her movies, such as I, Tonya, About Time, and so much more! This movie is an inspiration for people who want to watch and see! Viewers who want to watch this movie watch it anywhere, anytime! Thank you, and have a nice day!!",1
"I read from many sources about Barbie being a hardcore feminist movie, just as bad as all recent Lucasfilm sludge. I'm happy to report it is not true.",1
"I know that Barbie is for Toy Story 2 3 and 4 but this Barbie is something else like a doctor, a sports girl, a cow girl in the city. Barbie is being used as a toy. From the beginning of the movie the kids started to break tea cups, tables and baby dolls. Barbie went to ugly Barbie to go to the real world to find her kid. I surprised that Barbie had a memory of her kid who used to play with her that she doesn't n't like anymore. So Ken takes over Barbie island while Barbie lies down on the floor like a toy. Barbie and the other girls makes the boys go to war. The old lady and Barbie thought about a little girl who loved playing with Barbie so much.",1
"""I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll...""",1
"Based on the decade old toys Barbie from Mattel, Barbie was released in summer 2023 and became one of the highlights beside Oppenheimer. This time Barbie ends in the real world California, as Will Ferrel plays the leader of the pack. I am no Barbie expert, but the acting is so good that they look like humans playing dolls. This movie are not just for Barbie die hard fans, but also Bronies, adults who grew up in the 1960s and the teens too. The visual effects are nice that ranks from the travel montage with the Dutch backgrounds to the California beach settings. With the Oscars and Golden Globes lists few weeks away I guess this cna get some.",1
"I won't waste too much time but save your money. It's amateur storytelling and whatever message exists is terrible. Hands down one of the worst films i've ever seen. Not sure which I hated most, the performances, the nonsensical plot, or the songs. The writers kissed pretty much any worthwhile mark you could have had with this material. It's like the writers never heard of character arcs or bothered even writing an outline. This was a hot mess. I don't understand anyone liking this film. Almost 2 hours and $20 I'll never get back. On the positive notes I liked.... well i'll think of something. Will Farrel was wasted in this film too. Ugh.",0
"This movie definitely wasn't what I expected it to be. Although it was funny, it also had me question a lot of things in life. It hit the heart, it made me cry, and it really shows what the reality of the real world was and how we can all discover ourselves and not be making ourselves into someone we aren't. I walked into the theater thinking it would be all fun and like any other Barbie animation made in the past, but it definitely stood out and all the actors did great. Most women will definitely feel a sense of courage to do what they want in life and maybe also the men.",1
"Pushing all of the serious reviews aside for a moment, this is a classic comedy of the thirties, updated for our times. Screwball comedies like ""Bombshell"" with Harlow and ""My Man Godfrey"" were wonderful satires. They centered around a battle of the sexes, with a female character dominant over the male lead. They were loaded with farcical situations and spoofing, as well as lots of physical comedy.",1
"I went in to this movie expecting a huge joke of a movie and came out with a smile on my face and a warm heart. So many things resonated with me, from the weird Barbie that I inherited from my older sister, to never really understanding where Ken lived or why he never went to work. Margot Robbie was the perfect Barbie. America Ferrera did a brilliant job of being a normal woman trying to explain how to be the 'perfect' woman to Barbie. Ryan Gosling STOLE THE MOVIE! His Ken was so insanely good and the 'I am just Ken' song and dance routine was insanely good! Thank you Greta Gerwig for writing this movie!",1
"I had high hopes for the 2023 Barbie movie, but sadly, it turned out to be an absolute disaster. It's hard to believe that a franchise as iconic as Barbie could produce something so disappointing.",0
"I really like how smartly this movie has been made. They kept the basics of the Barbie as we we know it intact, the fake beach, the food, the car, etc etc., they showed all Barbie's from all ethnicities and than they try to blend it with the real world to give us two perspectives, Beautiful!",1
"My Review - Barbie
In Cinemas now
My Rating 6.5/10",1
"On the plus side, this was an ambitious, dazzling film with what I felt was an original concept. It explored the world of gender stereotyping and male-female relationships, using the world of Barbie and Ken as its base point. There was a strong feminist theme running through it, but I did not find this overwhelming. Whilst the male figures were often portrayed as stupid and one-dimensional, this was done with some wit and indeed affection.",1
"I'm one of those. But, I have many others in my life, who I work with and live with, and so it was great to view the world through their eyes for a couple hours and get my head around issues that impact them. It was a funny and entertaining movie. Just go to it aware that there's quite a bit of sociological dialogue. America Ferrera's soliloquy in the middle of the movie was powerful and would have been, IMO, more powerful if it hadn't been surrounded by so many others like it before and after. But the issues are complex and could not possibly be ""covered"" by just one scene, so that's understandable. It feels good to be heard, and there's a lot to hear here but nothing for men to fear. The one thing I did not like was when one male character ""admitted"" that we (men) do a better job hiding the patriarchy in modern times. C'mon. Has there been progress or not? That statement creates distrust and erases good will. There's been progress... yay! We need more progress... okay, let's go!",1
"Not just the intro, but the whole movie is funny and smart as hell. You are griped by the voice of Helen Mirren, interactive singing by Liso and a strong focus on humor. The details in Barbieland are hilarious. There is no water in the shower or glasses, the pool is a decoration, every night is a girl's night. It shows you how great imagination is, especially kids imagination. And it guides you to perceive the movie with an open mind. After Barbie and Ken enter the real world, it can be even more unhinged and crazy than Barbieland. What helps you to just go with it, is that this 'real world' is also shown as fiction, in details. The all the way up button in the elevator, the immediate response of the director of Mattel, that they had to get Barbie in the box, meeting the ghost of an old lady. It really helps you to let that absurd concept entertain you on every level. So you laugh a lot, cry a bit, feel motivated and you hope that everyone is truly listening to the message to love yourself.",1
"I identify as both Barbie and Ken... This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and it even made me cry. This film is such a raw, yet humorous look at how hard life is, as well as gender and everything that falls under that... From how the patriarchy hurts both men and women, how hard it is to live and not be exceptional, and the ideas at play in life. I loved the costume and set design, it feels like everyone in this film really cared about the franchise of Barbie. I feel like all of imagination at play is gorgeous. The soundtrack is also an amazing piece here. I've seen this film twice, and it has truly affected my life... Incredible.",1
"This movie was everything that was expected of it. It was funny, feministic, cute, beautiful and everything plastic. It was probably expected by many that the movie would be very superficial and focus more on the fun side of barbie, but it surprised us. This movie took a deep dive into what it is to be a girl and a woman in today's society and in the patriarchal world we live in today. It also brought into daylight the problematic history surrounding the plastic doll with many humorous elements. The only thing that brought this film down from a 10/10 was that it was everything we expected, and was missing a surprising plot twist. All in all I really recommend to watch this movie, it was a wonderful experience in the cinema!",1
"Having seen this movie twice now, I've laughed, I've cried and I enjoyed every minute of this movie! When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was thinking there is no way this movie will be any good! Well I am happy to say that I am wrong because I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end! Margot Robbie was great as Barbie while Ryan Gosling was great as Ken! It also stars America Ferreira, Will Farrell and other A-List actors! It definitely has a great story line to it and the soundtrack was also amazing! For those who are skeptical about the movie, DON'T BE! I highly recommend it.",1
"I really wanted to like the movie, and I totally enjoyed the first third of it, until it turned into a lecture on patriarchy. Women are portrayed as infinitely oppressed people who can't do anything except for crying about their existence.",0
If ur over 13 this movie will most definitely bore you. The movie tried so hard to make a point yet still failed.,0
I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.,1
"Walk into this film, not completely knowing what to expect but came out pleasantly surprised. Good set designs a lot of good shots throughout the film. Pretty solid humor throughout the film. So overall good experience. But now, in terms of casting Margot Robbie was a great choice for Barbie, but man does Ryan gosling really steal the show almost makes me wish he was in more comedies. Will Ferrell also makes an appearance and there's a pretty good job. And in terms of the overall message definitely wasn't as preachy as most people put it out to be. So I don't think the overall message was as bad as some people had it out but overall a fan film would recommend.",1
"I had moderate to slightly high expectations and that's what I got... well, maybe a little less.",1
"This movie is a mess. Story line is horrific ,and the writing is horrendous.it feels like somone put the script in a mixer grinder and made a shake out of it. Im still confused as to what the movie actually wants to potray.theres not a clear intended audience for this . It references so many old movies which makes it way too boring. Even the dialogues are boring . There is not a clear line in the story line. Way too much plugging of outfits.the producer actually spent more time on marketing than they on getting a good storyline.tmost of the jokes were annoying and cheesy.overall the movie is wierd and bogus.",0
"This movie was such a fun watch, the comedy (especially by Ryan Gosling) carried the film for me. However the deeper meaning of the movie wasn't lost either.",1
Started well including the scene where Barbie removes her feet from her shoes and remains the same shape (as per the trailer) but after Barbie and the characters were introduced the script began to lose its way. As though the writer tried to include little memories or what would be nice rather than a theme or good story throughout. If you have nothing to do worth watching but if you are expecting laughs or a wow factor don't expect too much. I think also instead of directing to children and adults just stick to one or other. Actors were all good but the story just let them down. Hopefully not a trilogy on the way.,1
"Didn't really know what to expect from this, but this is one of the best films of the year. Laugh-out-loud funny and heartfelt, Margot and Ryan Gosling throw themselves head first into Barbie and Ken like some kind of Zoolander/Legally Blonde/Lego Movie hybrid, but far more intelligently written.",1
"This movie was so absurd and so fun! I laughed so hard my face hurt. I see people feeling like this movie concluded that women are better than men, but the lesson was to celebrate womanhood in all its forms, with the overarching message for everyone being to find who you are on your own. Barbie told ken he should stand in his own light and find out who he is outside of his relationship with her! He's kEnough!!! I think because this was such a big budget and highly publicized movie, people don't super know who greta gerwig is and how her past movies have really celebrated womanhood through all its phases, especially the messy parts. It was so fantastic and so nuanced and self aware, i'm grateful this movie exists! P.s. If ur mad that the barbies didn't give the kens true parity and just threw some lower level judge position at them, then wait until you find about what the supreme court in the real world does!!!!",1
The movie was weirdly quick at the beginning and weirdly long at the end. The beginning of the film felt like a glorified way to show off Margot Robbie's feet. The movie it self was quite meta at times and even made me laugh but I felt like it had too much hype. Also was the movie about sexism or getting older and was Will Ferril the villain or was Ken. There were just somethings that didn't need to be in this. Greta Gerwig is a great director Wonder Woman proves that it's just this movie could have been different. I Manley started re-enjoying the movie was when the kens had their battle. Sorry if I have wasted your time but that's my opinion.,1
"Like I said, this movie is just chef's kiss. It's funny, airy but also has a deep meaning when us women can relate to. I have never felt so understood watching the movie and I hope that men will learn to understand it as well. Honestly the movie brought me to tears, especially the end. The music, cast, script and the acting were perfection.",1
"While this movie is worth seeing and contains some humorous moments, as well as Ryan goslings 'I'm just Ken' being one of the highlights, I wasn't a fan of the men vs women portrayal, and the plot wasn't the best. For example, why did the Mattel board chase barbie into barbieland when what they wanted was for her to go back there and how did the Ken's brainwash intelligent barbies in such a short period of time. Also some of the references were a bit obscure and the end dragged on for at least 10 minutes too long. However it is worth noting that the costume and set design was astonishing and enhanced the experience of the movie.",1
"I heard it was preachy before going to watch it, but still expected it to be a fun, easy watch. I feel like this is being rated higher because people think there's an important message in there but this shouldn't distract anyone from the fact that it's a very, very bad film with a terrible storyline. After a promising start it becomes excruciatingly boring and predictable. The storyline is what you'd expect from a poorly written children's film, but its wrapped in a heavy handed adult theme. Box office smash but it will be forgotten very quickly. Only highlights were Margot Robbie's performance and Michael Cera and Kate Mckinnons small but funny parts.",0
"It has great moments. The beginning might be the strongest I've ever seen. Unique. The soundtrack has a few songs that fall flat but overall it was very strong. Cinematography was unreal. Calling the old woman beautiful was rare and cool. The writing does seem to break down eventually though like really dropping the ball articulating the themes at times. Its not ""dark, weird, and crazy"" to have thoughts about death. That was just a strange choice. Margot Robbie had the best performance by far.",1
"Describing this film is quite a challenge, as it falls into a peculiar realm for all the wrong reasons.",0
"The movie as it is is really great and the work on it deserves all the best critics...
But I personally haven't strongly connected to the storyline. They really could have came up with much better strory line which would make this amazingly done movie even better.",1
Family/adult film mashed in really well! The trailer barely shows anything about how deep the movie is; I really appreciate that! I'm sure production design will surely get recognition at the Oscars I love that they used so much pink they had to get more. I saw it inRPX with my sister Emily which was quite spectacular except for several audience members that were obnoxious and barely seemed into the movie those people like that are strange.,1
"Barbie has exceeded the expectations of many viewers, what we thought was going to be a movie for ""kids"" has ended up being a movie full of social criticism, satire and a great sense of humor. The female empowerment that Greta Gerwig presents to us is relentless, showing various situations in which women find themselves involved on a daily basis, as well as various cliches that surround them.",1
"Begrudgingly, I took my granddaughter and her friend to this movie, who dressed in high heels and pink checkered dresses to match the one Barbie wears in the movie. They looked adorable. It was really good. Not one of my top 10 best ever, movies. But not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I particularly liked the ""KEN"" dance, although the two teenyboppers beside me laughed all the way through the scene. Personally I think Ryan Gosling carried the movie, and the only thing that kept me entertained. He was excellent. I asked the girls if they know what the overall message of the movie was about, and both said ""No"" rather nonchalantly. I asked what was there best part, and both said, ""I don't know"", what was your least favourite part? ""I don't know"". Did you like the movie, and both said ""Yes"". I thought the messaging was good for an adult, but it went over the heads of the young teens.",1
"Up to 80% of the storyline the film was great and tapped into essential topics of personal development and gender identities, reflecting and criticising society. The cast and characters had flair in the right amount of depth and dimensionality as well as chemistry amongst them. Also great that by the time the choreographed dancing scene(s) came in, the viewer had gotten the chance to properly care about what had been building up and then, the songs had real impact. It made for some good fun and laughs.",1
"I'm a bit late to the party here (1500 reviews, wow!) so I'm not expecting this review to go very far. But, man, what an amazingly creative film. And hilarious. I haven't laughed this much at a movie in a long time. Not necessarily one I was running out to see in the theater, but as soon as it was on Max I queued it up. My daughters and wife have seen it, and I loved it. I mean maybe a couple of moments were the tiniest bit uncomfortable? But for any of the hate about this movie being preachy, etc, I can only say I applaud its subversiveness in its women-versus-men central conflict.",1
"Yes, it was funny. That's all I thought it was. But, I'm 7 months pregnant with my first child, a girl, and I couldn't stop crying through ANYTHING remotely touching. It was wonderful. Not too political. Just really thoughtful and sweet. Yes, it was over the top, but in a good way. Barbie and the Barbie/universe did a good job of making fun of itself, I recognized so many Barbies that I used to play with as a little girl, and I felt the feeling over again watching this movie that one gets when they start to grow up and grow out of playing with their Barbies. If you've seen Toy Story 2, it's a similar feeling to that ""when she loved me"" moment. But then there are more heartfelt moments beyond that.",1
I certainly didn't expected this film to be what it is...,1
"Barbie changed me for the better. It made me appreciate being a woman all over again, it made me appreciate my mother more and it made me more grateful to have 3 little girls. It'll make Barbie playtime more special and fun. It'll be a staple in my home and something that grows with me and my girls. It was funny, emotional, energetic and wholesome. Every time Barbie cried, I cried. Every time she laughed , I laughed. Growing up Barbie was my go to toy , it brought me comfort and fun. And as I had my girls it brings me joy to stand in the Barbie aisle as they pick out their favorite Barbie. Thank you so much for this movie. üíï",1
"The campaign behind this movie had to be one of the best in film history. No movie ever seemed to be talked about ahead of its arrival more than Barbie, and not just by one group of people (as in Marvel movies or Star Wars etc) but by segments all across society. The excitement for Barbie was almost palpable throughout the country -- a brilliant campaign.",0
"Firstly, the marketing for Barbie was great. The cinema was full of people wearing Pink when I watched Barbie on Friday and Oppenheimer on Saturday.",1
"I absolutely loved this movie and the social manifest it represents! We are all humans after all. Thank you Margot Robbie for being such an amazing woman, feminist (a real one), actress, producer, creative artist, and so forth. Thank you to the screen writers Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, for the amazing, fun, serious, subtil, exagerated, simple story you made real. Also, Ryan Gosling as Ken? Perfect match. What an amazing performance! To be honest, the entire cast was on point. America Ferrera never disappoints, absolutely impecable performance. Thank you all for this work of art! I'll rewatch it and rewatch it and rewatch it, and I'll spread the word of this movie to the seven winds!",1
"I saw this movie right now and mostly enjoyed it. The good parts are really enjoyable, but sometimes I was just bored. I really don't know how they did it, but near the end of the movie some scenes were the peak of cinema and some were just uninteresting.",1
"""Barbie (22023)"" takes Barbie on an awesome space adventure, set in the future. The movie has stunning visuals as Barbie faces cosmic challenges with bravery and smarts. It teaches us the importance of understanding others and being true to ourselves.",1
"I loved the music , and the fun start.",1
Barbie,0
"Barbie is a thoughtful homage to an iconic toy brand that overturns the well known stereotype of the blonde, plastic ""bimbo"". It is also undeniably Mattel's punt at keeping Barbie relevant and commercially viable for the next generation.",1
"I didn't have a lot of big expectations for this movie, so imagine how happy and surprised I was about how much I enjoyed it! It's silly, and fun and then BOOM- existentialism! While I wouldn't recommend this movie for under 10- there's A LOT of innuendo that will probably go over many younger viewers heads, but there are a couple parts that might not be best for the littles, IMO. The soundtrack is amazing and the story is a lot deeper than one would expect! Margot Robbie is a delight, as is Ryan Gosling. The entire cast is wonderful! Issa Rae never disappoints and her role as President Barbie! A truly fun summer movie!",1
"The social commentary was pretty heavy-handed. Albeit, this is to be expected in the Barbie movie. However, it was genuinely funny. A lot of creativity and imagination went into this movie which ads to the charm. There were tons of little details that could make this a movie great to own and watch more than once. Plot was a cute but could have been smarter. Its nice to see a new movie that isn't just a remake or a sequel but I fully expect to see a franchise for this. I appreciated the few times that they seemingly poked fun at feminism. In one the of the final scenes, the creator of barbie character said that the patriarchy was something that was made up to deal with how the world is.",1
"I went into the theater with no expectations, somebody had told me the movie was good and I was curious, but I didn't really know what I was getting into.",1
"This film is rotten. Seriously. I decided to go and see it thanks to the good reviews. Well, I'm not sure who is leaving these reviews, but this is a terrible film and is one of the worst big budget films I have seen in a long time. The acting is average really, I suppose that Robbie and Gosling tried their hardest but clearly the script failed them as it all makes zero sense. It feels like a string of clips put together rather than a real film, it's all disconnected and disjointed. The film is colourful but sometimes films can be too colourful, and this is a great example of that. It's like they added this colour in to distract you from the poor nature of the film.",0
"For one. I really liked it and all the people I know that went to liked it and most of them did get emotional throughout( tears) . But I did show emotions in it but not as prominent , the movie will help people through times that some people have not been through (ie men) but even if you are a man I would still recommend this movie I have no real big complaints but also nothing to right home about that won't give anything away. Other than it's humar and when to use it , the movie knows when to crack a joke and when to move the plot further, I did really like the premise I'm glad how they went for the story and once again i would recommend it to anyone, most complaints that I have heard in person are from people that didn't give it a good try.",1
"Wish I could give Barbie 11 stars! I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a very long time! In fact, I've already seen it FOUR times and if I can find another friend who hasn't seen it yet, I'll go again!",1
"I saw this movie in theatres, and I found it kind of underwhelming. Each and every act of the film feels so different and disconnected from the other, and by the end it feels like the plot looses traction. But that doesn't mean I thought the movie was bad, I thought it was funny and charming all throughout, but I guess my issue is that I'm in the wrong demographic. Near the beginning and near the end, there's a strong theme of motherhood and the troubles of being a woman, and as a man, I can't relate. As a result, I had a hard time relating to a lot of this movies big plot points and emotional moments. And on top of that, halfway though it becomes exceedingly boring. But overall, I'd say it's a solid 7/10.",1
"I bought into the marketing hype and boy did this movie deliver! It was smart, funny, charismatic, visually pleasing and touching!",1
"I swear to god this movie is one of the best i've seen this year. My expectations were high BUT NOT THAT HIGH. I'm not sure if this movie is good for small kids, they may not understand the problems this film addresses. I'm really happy that this movie was created because we should talk more about this problem (I don't wanna say what is this problem coz it would be a spoiler and i want you guys to have a surprise). And seeing Ryan Gosling in this role is something i would never expect to see. We know Ryan from all those mysterious and dark action films so seeing him dancing in colorful clothes and doing all these crazy stuff is incredible. I love this man and I love him even more now, i'm so grateful that he took part in such a great project that addresses such a huge problems. If you're still wondering if you should go or not the answer is YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO GO.",1
I felt the story was missing a lot. There were a lot of points but they all were poorly placed.,0
"It's taken me a couple of days to ponder over what I really thought of this movie. That's a plus, in that it really made me think. However the more I think about it, the more turned off I am by the whole thing.",1
"Ok this is at its baseline absolutely unbelievably awesome. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (Barbie and Ken) are absolutely excellent and the whole thing manages to be visually breathtakingly stunning, good kind of surreal, hilariously and cleverly funny and touch some pretty on point philosophical questions in a sort of lighthearted but poignant way.",1
"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",1
"The Barbie movie left me with a deep sense of disappointment in my cinematic journey. From my perspective, the film failed to captivate and provide an entertaining experience, and its storyline appeared to lack depth and substance. Regrettably, it seemed to target a younger demographic, leaving little to engage more mature viewers.",0
"I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much from Barbie, but this was bad. An awful plot with some very unnecessary sequences, and it feels far too preachy to be an enjoyable movie. There is a good movie in there somewhere, but it is buried underneath unnecessary characters and preachy dialogue. I personally would not recommend watching this in theaters, if I hadn't been watching it with my friends (so that we could joke about how bad it was) I would have felt that I had wasted 2 hours of my life. Of course, maybe this movie just isn't my cup of tea. Other than the poor plot, I thought that the acting was done reasonably well, about what you would expect with the cast of the movie, and there were a few funny moments sprinkled in there as well.",0
"Greta Gerwig's latest offering, ""Barbie"", starring the effervescent Margot Robbie and the charismatic Ryan Gosling, had high expectations to meet. The film provides an ample amount of humor and maintains an enjoyable pace. However, it falls short of its potential as a sharp, thought-provoking commentary on our society's obsession with aesthetic perfection and constructed identities.",1
"Seen this as a birthday present with my mom and sister. My birthday was on the 21st, but I ended up seeing the Barbie movie on the 22nd - Joan jett's birthday, wearing my Joan Jett necklace that I had received as a birthday gift, along with my Joan Jett slash Barbie inspired outfit. So, this will go down in history as a very special movie outing for me. I felt like I was going to the actual premiere!",1
"I went into this movie thinking it would be a mature twist on the classical Barbie figure and the 'ideal' life of Barbie & Ken, as Barbie related content is usually known for.",1
"I hope you won't let the title of the film fool you; this is not some family movie for little girls. It is an all around auteuristic film by the ever great Greta Gerwig, and an instant classic cult film.",1
"I'm not even joking when I say this was the most moving film I've ever seen. Going into this I expected the outcome to be one of two things: either is was going to be very dumb and bad, or it would be absolutely amazing. No in between. And now, I can confidently say that it was absolutely amazing. It made me laugh, it made me tear up, it made me feel so much more than I ever could have expected a movie about Barbies, or any toys in general, to make me feel. I genuinely believe that it is going to be one of the most influential movies of this generation.",1
"Barbie is a good movie. The visuals are nice to look at, the premise is quirky, the dialogues are often witty, it's somewhat self-aware, and even (some of) the songs are pretty great. It made me laugh, it made me smile, and that's great.",1
"We can be surprised at the bold feminist narrative of this film, which turned out to be a larger portion of the movie that most anticipated, but we should all learn from it. How urgent is an appreciation for women and their leadership if it takes a movie about literal toys in a fantasyland to see a female president? Barbie shows us what society would look like if women occupied ALL of the roles currently held by men, which quickly illustrates the alarming lack of representation. Barbie points out the irony in laughing an all-female Supreme Court, when the United States Supreme Court (for example) was all-male for its first 191 years. Barbie's achievements extend to business leadership, Nobel Prizes, and space travel.",1
"If you are expecting it to be so stupid ur gonna love it... Ur in the right place. I refused to watch extras and trailers, I wanted to be surprised. And I was! It's cheesey AF at first.. if u can get past 15 mins of everyone saying the name Barbie, you will survive this movie. In the beginning they ""flip"" through past Barbies and I seen quite a few that used to own.. they also ""flash"" through some barbie clothes that will bring u right back to childhood. For nastalgia sake this movie will not disappoint... For new comer's sake, this movie will not disappoint! We counted the reasons why it's rated PG-13 and it's kinda hilarious.",1
"Brilliantly written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Everyone in this is fantastic. It's a wink at nostalgia and commentary on society. Never played with Barbies but my daughter did. Tribute to the inventor of Barbie, Ruth Handler. Helen Mirren narrates. Kate McKinnon almost steals the movie. Not a movie for little kids but most of the references will probably go over their heads. My girlfriend and I laughed out loud many times. It's about 20 minutes too long for my taste. The music is spot on. It's a perfect summer movie. Guess what? It has value and substance. Margot Robbie is not only gorgeous but more importantly, she's highly intelligent as actor and producer. This movie is going to make bank!",1
"Well barbie (2023) movie actually out of my expectation, i know barbie always been supporting feminist but this time barbie movie showing us how being feminist without even makes men feels underestimated. So, the whole plot was perfectly wrapped by good spices and well-written.",1
"Barbie made a strong start really. Loved the characters, loved the production design and love love the acting of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling but then along the way something happened and the characters dev becomes confusing.",1
"Funny thing to say about a Barbie movie, means I had my hopes too up, but it's more about who directed it, I think she's pretty good.",1
"It's taken me many months to be able to absorb this film to the point where I can write about it in some way. Being honest, there is too much exposition at the beginning of the film, the plot development is a bit shaky and sometimes the suspension of disbelief is hanging by a thread. However, what this film gets right, it gets right to such a high degree, and so much better than any other film-maker has been capable of, that it has to go into the ""above and beyond"" category, a masterpiece. What this film is about is men and women, this movie encapsulates the state of the modern western world. It grapples with the weightiest of issues with deft skill, and incredible fearlessness. It shows men in the modern world as they are (on the whole), and it shows women in the modern world as they are (on the whole), and it shows why and how, and the consequences of, men holding on to the old order - it shows how men infantilize themselves, constantly looking for validation, becoming macho characatures, aping some old forgotten code which has died, in the hope to attract women who have moved on and are looking for something different. It hints at the violence and culture of fear that lurks behind the surface of narcissistic charm. In many ways, because of its consumerist anchoring, this story becomes the story of the modern world and it's development and evolution to the point where we are now, the plot is irrelevant, but the story is something eternal, marking this moment in time.",1
"""Barbie"" is undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable films I've seen this year and yet it's also the most infuriating. Highly imaginative, (it's got the best pre-credit sequence in years), and laugh-out-loud funny it's got ideas to burn and therein lies the problem. Director and co-writer, (with partner Noah Baumbach), Greta Gerwig has set out to make the ultimate feminist tract dressed up in the brightest of pinks as a satire and while it works perfectly well as a satire full of self-conscious digs at its very creation, (we are constantly being reminded this is a movie called ""Barbie"" that we're watching), it's as a tract that it's in danger of sinking. That it doesn't is very much to Gerwig's credit; she's much too smart to really ruin her product and there is an awful lot here to enjoy.",1
"Weeks ago I heard that there was going to be a Barbie movie coming out and my immediate first thought was ""Oh, God."" I then forgot about it and then saw the trailer for it when we went to see the new Indiana Jones movie. I always enjoy seeing Margot Robbie when I can and Ryan Gosling looked like he was going to bring some humor to the movie, so when my wife asked if I wanted to see it, I said SURE! I'm glad I did.",1
"If you told me a few years ago that one of the best movies in 2023, and arguably the highest-grossing one is going to be Barbie, I would have laughed and called you crazy. But here we are, and the atmosphere in the theatre felt like a cultural revolution, which can become ""You just had to be there"" moment for the Gen-Zs.",1
"When things start going awry in Barbieland, it is up to 'stereotypical Barbie' (blonde hair, blue eyed version) to reset the matriarchal pieces in the perfect plastic world that represents everyone equally...or slightly less equal (if inverse to reality were offsetting). While Robbie is an idealistic Barbie, Gosling's charismatic nature completely directs attention away from Margot anytime the two share frame - it really does become the Ken movie for much of the second act as Gosling's character dominates the screen.",1
Funny.,1
"When I went to watch this movie, I went to watch it as the amazing combo, Barbinheimer (Barbie and Oppenheimer). I tried my best to avoid spoilers for both of these movies, and let me just say, going into this movie blind made this a phenomenal experience. The way Stereotypical Barbie changes is a pleasant surprise. And the way this movie deals with problems in modern society upfront and, while admittedly toned down a bit, they're all still there. The plot of this movie makes it a fantastic watch, and I was delighted by not only how the jokes were seamlessly thrown in, but the jokes themselves. This movie wasn't only just Kenough. This was so much more than being just Kenough for the children and adults in the audience. The movie's so self-aware, but it isn't the usual type, this is a type of self-awareness that can lead you to view the world differently. The problems Barbie struggles with aren't unreasonable, they're relatable at heart and spread a good message. This movie is wonderful and I highly recommend it.",1
Watched it at home yesterday. In the first 30 minutes it was boring and then it became dreadful and unwatchable. It is sooooo mediocre that I don't understand what was going through the minds of those involved in it. How did this seem good is beyond me. What happened to cinematography? How did we come to this insufferable mess? Where is the fun is this? It is a movie so stupid with no meaning at all. Nothing that happens has a meaning. Why the characters do what they do makes no sense. How did they write the script and thought it was good? How could everyone who read the script not understand how pathetic it was? This is not a movie. This is a failing attempt to make a movie but they definitely achieved everything they could with the marketing strategy. Stupid senseless piece of garbage.,0
"I appreciated the creative nature of the film and applaud breaking out of the formulaic box. Having said that, there are still narratives present in the film that are prominent in todays culture. Gender Identity is still a common theme which plays out on a multitude of levels in the film. I am not an academic and probably can't articulate the intellectual philosophies the movie contained.",1
"I found it to be a surprising grand piece of comedic, satire story telling, again concerning questions of gender roles and toxic masculinity. By the end I was moved to tears for Barbie AND Ken. It represented to me many issues of modern times and things I was confronted with in real life. The candy pop world and performances added so much to it to support the story and as a set designer I found the Barbieworld of course mesmerizing, melancholic and so well done. I hope, apart from all the social media hype, it will do some good in the world, heals girls, women, boys and men... and all those men who got dragged by their girlfriends and found it a reminder we dont need the other gender to support our worth. It is and was the hardest lesson to learn.... for me.",1
"This movie is absolutely amazing! It totally makes you think about the current society and what we really do prioritise and favour. Went into it without knowing what sort of angle they would take, and I was so extremely surprised and pleased with how Greta has done this. I can truthfully say I had a smile on my face for most of the movie, however there was times where tears were also shed due to the meaning of the film. Casting was a brilliant choice, Margot was the perfect fit for Barbie and Ryan a great Ken. Also want to mention that America and Kate did awesome jobs with their characters. A must watch, possibly best movie of the year!",1
At the interval I was surprised of how much I was enjoying Barbie with its amazing humour which was super ironic and subtle commentary on male patriarchy and consumerism. The overall theme of the movie was also quite good reflecting many aspects of human life and how it becomes more critical with age. But it was so disappointing in the third act which takes away the brilliant build up. Ryan Gosling showed his ranged and made me laugh so many times. Margot Robbie shined brilliantly just like she does during the whole film. But I expected more from Barbie and Greta Gerwig didn't satisfy me. She should have tried for a different sort of ending.,1
"The entire cast does such a great job and it seems everyone had a fun time making the film. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are of course stand outs, but Michael Cera as Allan and Issa Rae as Barbie were also phenomenol! The sets were gorgeous, according to behind the scenes, everything was practical when it could be, and that made such an obvious difference in bringing the Barbie world to life. The costumes!!! So much fun, so much pink, and Robbie's long-standing relation with chanel wormed it's way into costuming as well, truly there are a bunch of unique and extremely well done pieces!",1
I saw it in a theater the day after I saw Oppenheimer and it was a fun movie.,1
"I doubt this film will be remembered in 80 years. Its no Wizard of Oz. However, it caught the zeitgeist in the summer of 2023. And made its truly talented female director hugely bankable.",1
"This is very much a movie that will get devided opinions on it, my cousin said well this is two hours of my life i will never get back, and me? I left the theatre in such a good mood. It was the sense of humor for me, laughed so hard. Specially Ryan Gossling was sooooo good and funny, many familiar faces to spot also. And margot robbie come on... the perfect casting for Barbie. I also have to say, the way they created Barbie land was so amazing, it just makes you just want to there. I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. I can understand not everyone will love it. But i am sure it is a iconic film already.",1
So good but the only part I don't like is the scene when the boys take over the town apart from that it's perfect. Barbie is a heartwarming family movie with great actors and a great freaking plot. Its my favorite movie and its highly recommended for a family but there some bad words like vagina and penis. I think it should be recommended for 12 and over. The rating 12A (12 adult ) and it is 1h and 54m. If u don't like comedy movies ( I'm sure u like comedy's) than this movie is not for u. Thank u all for reading this review and I hope u read my other reviews. (By the way my reviews have spoilers),1
"If forgotten, Ryan Gosling started off in the mickey mouse club. Important to remember because wow what a talented individual. Recent memory sees him leading roles that require a more stoic subdued approach, and it can be easy to miss his range. Barbie seeks to utilize all his acting muscles, and to a resounding success. He can sing, dance, act, and do comedy.",1
"On the surface, ""Barbie"" looks fun and light but nothing could be further from the truth, as this movie delves into some dark stuff. That's why it works. It presents an optimistic world that is all facade, and if you peel away the layers, you are reminded of the reality that things are not so great. You could say that there is some level of men-bashing here, but that is all in service to how Mattel has chosen to portray the Ken doll as mere accessory to Barbie. So the movie doubles down on that, and with the comedic talent of Ryan Gosling, the movie gets to up the ante on the patriarchy satire. I especially like the part when Ken learns and practices to wave his finger 'no' at a female assistant. As for the casting of Barbie, Margot Robbie does a great job and truly fits the Barbie look. However in my mind the celebrity actress most physically resembling Barbie has always been 1970s Priscilla Barnes from ""Three's Company."" And kudos to America Ferrera's funny, nuanced portrayal of a mom having an existential crisis. How about that monologue? I love the satire part of this movie, including the musical numbers, and I see where they are going with the philosophical musings at the end, but the sappiness becomes too much.",1
"Barbie is agonizingly close to being a masterpiece. Imagine your run of the mill 2020s high budget film. Now let's go through it with a fine comb and add a bunch of brilliant tiny details to the first two acts, but then let's have a third act that fits the modern trend of overstaying its welcome and failing to provide satisfactory answers to its own questions and lacks all those fun little bits that made you love the first two thirds of the movie.",1
"I had my reservations going in due to the fact that this was directed by ""mumblecore"" maestro Gerwig, who was last seen modernising little women to ensure a more feminist ending, but the trailers gave the impression of a fun dish out of water, Elf Meeta enchanted vibe.",0
LIKES:,1
Greta Gerwig did it. Broke the ceiling financially for a movie directed by a woman.,1
"The marketing for this movie was incredible, so are actors and the whole setting. Not only does that attract a massive audience, but also seeing the famous doll many grew up with. Unfortunately, once I got into my theather seat the hype begin to wear drown. I can not wrap my mind around all the positive reviews on the script and Greta because the plot of this movie is full of major gaps and unreached points. It dives into politics but can not decide what to do with it so instead runs a couple of pointless monolouges that bring no value or add to the conclusion of the movie whatsoever. Not to mention I found myself consistently unsure of what is happening and why. This movie presents itself as a comedy and the audience was dead quiet throught the whole thing! Kudos to Ryan Gosling whose acting skills might be the highlight of this whole experience even when Ken as a charachter made little to no sense. All this amazing cast and promotion might have been too big of a bite for the directors. It felt like they exploited that in all possible ways in order to cover up a weak plot.",0
"Truthfully, after seeing this film once, I did not realize just how many gems there are in it. Everything in the movie is representative of something else. It is more than just literal. For eg. Barbie was not into Ken as we are accustomed to because her owner did not have a Ken doll. The adding on of the character Ruth gave so much life to this movie. This one was definitely dedicated to women. As a girl, if you haven't seen it, I would recommend you go as soon as you can. It is especially empowering to young girls because it truly shows the essence of a woman. The trailer was not enough to capture the beauty of this movie. It was definitely more than what I expected. I completely understand why anyone would think that the men were portrayed as 'dumb' (obviously in the real world, men aren't as bad as the movie makes it seem) but I think what was meant to come from this movie was a deeper message, and this may have been necessary to really capture what the movie was trying to portray for all women. It was needed to emphasize the movie so to speak.",1
"First half was very enjoyable, but the rest felt rushed and with no direction. Like it didn't really know what to focus on.",1
": I feel confused about this movie, probably like a lot of people, on one hand I laughed as I hadnt with a movie in a long time and the vibe this movie has is just very appealing, but on the other hand while not being an anti-men movie and actually trying to have a deep message, it feels at some parts like a tantrum. The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.",1
"I had high expectations based off the trailer and had purchased quite a lot of merchandise in the lead up to the films release, however for me that's as good as it got, brilliant marketing. The first 20 minutes were funny and entertaining but that swiftly turns sour and boring, leading onto an hour and a half of speeches and overly serious moments that just weren't that touching. I can see what they were trying to do with #girlpower but I found it a little toxic and very much like they were trying to 'put ken back in his place' which I get is probably a metaphor for how modern day women are still treated however if you're trying to show feminism to a young audience it really needs to show actual feminism and not just toxic girl power. I would have loved for the ending to have involved an equal balance between the kens and the barbies to show what a real 'dream world' looks like. The Speeches felt very overdone and they suffocated the whole film. At least a quarter of the people in the cinema left half way through.",0
"This movie, wow. Just wow. This was unlike anything I had expected going in to seeing Barbie earlier today. I figured by the trailers alone it was going to be a fun popcorn movie filled with adventure and eventual romance between Barbie and Ken with it ending with them getting together, beating bad guys when crossing into our world and living happily ever after",1
"BARBIEHEIMER is among us! Between BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER releasing on the same week, the wife really wanted to see this first and I obliged.",1
I was never a fan of Barbie. I was a tomboy as a kid and the closest I had to a Barbie was the Donny and Marie Osmond celebrity dolls from Mattel which I never actually took out of their boxes. I preferred reading a book up in a tree or playing with my pets or baking rather than playing with dolls.,1
"The colors, shots, houses, clothes were really amazingly done. Margot and Rayan were amazing, beautiful and acted well. I will say that. I find that the movie wasn't THAT good. The story wasn't as entertaining as it could. This was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but I didnt find most of the jokes funny, i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle. I wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more. The ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters. Ken is a cool character i gotta say. He deserves the world and to really find something more about him. So i wouldn't say it was a bad movie, its okay to watch more casually, more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia. I was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta say.",1
"Barbie was an incredible movie and experience. There was a perfect balance between the replication of our own childhood experiences with the dolls, and the introduction of the hopeful changes for the current state of the world. The way the movie made our little imaginations come to life on the big screen was magical. It was great to see a movie about barbie, the stereotypical perfect doll , being so inclusive and aware of issues we still have today. It was emotional, funny, and a breath of fresh air. Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and the rest of the cast... just bravo. It was truly so wonderful & I can't wait to watch it again.",1
"First 10mins was annoying, then it came around as it showed us it was self-aware enough to realise. Over and hour in i was enjoying it. The comedy is on point all round. Then came the part when the women plot to lie and ""cheat"" on their boyfriends at the beach...
That was a bit evil?. Im sure a lot of kids went to see this film and teens. The cinema i was in was sure packed but that wasnt a good message. ""To save barbieland we must lie and cheat on our boyfriends"" not sure a lot of parents would like that message either. Then the film wraps up wonderfully about barbie becoming human and herself instead of playing the role of barbie which was wonderful.. But are we supposed to just pretend and forget the message of this film just five minutes ago is to cheat on your boyrfriends and lie to them once youve gained their trust and made them happy? Hmm. Ryan gosling however was amazing to witness. Totally amazing just like he was in any other gosling film. Drive and blade runner being my favs.",1
"The story in Barbie isn't about a doll. It's about reconciling the imperfect world we live in with the idealized stories we tell and create. We use our dolls, toys, and play to create those stories. We internalize the ideals shared through those stories. Sometimes they are good ideals that empower us. Sometimes they are toxic ideals that disempower us. Ultimately they are created by us and we are influenced by them.",1
"BARBIE (2023)
Greetings again from the darkness. A reasonable assumption could be made that a movie based on a doll so popular with pre-adolescent girls would be geared towards that audience. However, this is the era of comic book movies targeting ""grown-ups"", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional LADY BIRD, 2017), Greta Gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with Barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting. This strategy has proven to be box office gold, and the heavy dose of cosplay at screenings proves the lasting impact this plastic doll has had on many women who lined up for tickets.",1
"Fantastic movie! The writing and storyline is so much deeper than I could have imagined for a Barbie movie. I loved this movie so much that I saw it twice opening week and plan to buy it once it hits streaming. I think women and girls of all ages will love it. I know plenty of guys who like it as well. It's smart, funny, clever, deep, thoughtful, etc. I was actually in tears during the America Ferrera monolog. These actors are all amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling were the perfect Barbie and Ken. The music was amazingly hilarious. The Ken battle scene cracked me up so much. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal. I loved her version of Little Women and this is every bit as good. Barbie is a must see. Don't wait, go see it now!",1
"I absolutely LOVED this movie! It was everything I could have ever wanted it to be and THEN SOME! Fun, empowering, intelligent, socially relevant, deeply moving and by far the pinkest movie l've ever seen! An all around an amazing experience and there's something in it for everyone! All genders, all ages, everyone can appreciate it. The entire audience seemed to have a blast throughout the movie. Everyone was laughing during the funny bits(and there were A LOT of them) and during the heartfelt, more emotional moments you could feel the energy shift and the messages the movie was trying to convey really being taken in. Amazing cast, excellent cinematography, fantastic soundtrack, you definitely want to see this one!",1
"I had no idea what to expect, but the trailers made me smile. Every after the seeing the trailers the movie was so much more weird and wonderful and pink than I'd even imagined. I laughed so hard. There is also a sweet message about the pressures of life and society and gender roles without being preachy. It feels like a message of kindness to ourselves and to others. I now know that I am Kenough.",1
"After seeing the movie twice, I think that a solid 8/10 is a fair rating for it. Not going to lie, I was very hyped for this movie for a long time and it did not disappoint. I think all of the bad reviews are really just people who did not understand it LOL the movie is most definitely not anti-men. I don't want to spoil it but, if anything, the ultimate message is very wholesome. The movie is funny and, by far, my favorite parts included the Kens (couldn't get ""I'm Just Ken"" out of my head for days afterwards).",1
"It's never good when the titular character of a film is one that is dislikable and annoying, but that is the case here. Barbie is a very one dimensional character here and is really grating. The other characters also lack any character depth at all.",0
"As a 39 year old female activist I immediately fell in love with this movie. The story, the actors, the music. And now my 10 year old son has watched it numerous times and is just as in love with it as me. This movie is a much watch. If only we had a bit of Barbie Land and the real world mixed together, the world would be a better place. Now I'm wondering if we will see a Ken movie. I think that would be a fun spin on the story. This is worth owning as you will want to watch it over and over again. It's funny and serious at the same time. Making light of a real systemic problem that is 100 percent a real thing.",1
"Wow is all I can say. So many layers that had my daughter and I smiling, laughing, and sobbing all at the same time. Absolute perfection. So brilliantly written. Everyone should see this movie. It was amazing!!! Aspects for generations of women to submerge themselves in and was also full of a beautiful nostalgia for all the little girls inside of us, and those still growing up. I can not say enough good things about this movie. Though some may not enjoy the truths behind what this movie stands for it was a true testament to our current state of the world and what weve had to deal with for forever. Again just absolutely brilliant.",1
"I enjoyed this film. I cried at the ending and I laughed out loud at some parts, which is something not many films can actually do to me. I LOVED the visuals - it felt exactly like Barbie should feel to look at, and I love how the film never seems to take itself too seriously, which again, is what I expect from a film about a Barbie doll.",1
"I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.",1
"A movie that delivered a great few laughs, with Gosling taking the show. Margot was fantastic, really showcasing her talent as an actor. However, for the main character of the show it did not seem that way - Ken took most of the limelight. Rightfully so with Ryan playing a stellar part.",1
"Visually, it was a great movie to watch - colourful, cute and quirky. I enjoyed the first 20 - 30 minutes and then it went downhill from there. There's a lot of fantastic actors in it but I didn't go in with high expectations as I had no idea what to expect.",1
"In the hands of another filmmaker, a ""Barbie"" film could have been a bland or soulless cash-grab just seemingly made to sell more of the iconic Mattel doll. But cinephiles know that Greta Gerwig's short-but-no-less-impressive track record of writing and directing is nothing short of superb, having made two outstanding films (2017's ""Lady Bird"" and 2019's ""Little Women."") Gerwig's films are always rooted in deep emotional affection and a profound understanding of womanhood with a level of emotional authenticity rarely seen in major Hollywood films. These levels of depth in her films are complemented by exceptionally clever and often funny writing. Needless to say, her take on ""Barbie"" is exceptional and certainly lives up to the seemingly earth-shattering hype. Gerwig and Baumbach's satirical screenplay is consistently hilarious from beginning to end, while depicting and analyzing themes related to feminism in a thoughtful and profound way. The film brilliantly threads the needle between being summer popcorn entertainment and being something far more original, creative, insightful, and clever than simply just that. The film's jokes come rapid-fire and are consistently hilarious in an intelligent way, even also poking fun at plenty of pop culture and film-related references that cinephiles will adore.",1
"The idea & theme was interesting, though the execution was poor, ultimately making the movie fall flat.",0
6.7/10,1
"Because of some reviews I thought that the movie was bad and innapropriate. But when I saw it I got shocked with the important and deep subjects that the movie talked about, and at the same time, I enjoyed the way that they talked about those sensitive subjects. I liked the way that they the movie had sad partes but that were funny and I liked the way that even when things were serious, they put them in an hilarious way.",1
"Ah, the Barbie doll-a cultural icon that has been both revered and reviled, often in the same breath. The 2023 film ""Barbie"" takes us on a whimsical yet poignant journey through the plastic corridors of Barbieland, a realm that mirrors our own societal norms and prejudices in a way that is both amusing and unsettling.",1
"This is a fun, clever film that does about as much with its premise as it possibly could. Margot Robbie is cast as a doll with a reputation for an unrealistic body type. Finding a way to make a doll not only human but relatable and compelling enough to anchor a feature film is a daunting challenge, but somehow Robbie does just that while also managing to look the part. Appropriately, the art direction is playful. For all the inventiveness of this film, its concept occasionally leaves its screenplay unfocused.",1
Barbie may seem like a kids movie at a glance but its more than that. Even though kids are going to love it (no doubt) this movie is specifically made for adults who used to play with the original Barbies. The Barbies that were shown in the movie being exact same as our own childhood dolls takes you back in the past.,1
"Opens with a great tribute to 2001: a Space Odyssey's ape sequence, setting the scene for the humour and satire to follow. Barbie and Ken escape from Barbieland into the real world, threatening societal breakdown in both as changes in one universe affects the other. Barbieland is effectively a Matriarchy where girls rule and the Kens just do Beach, play sports, stand around and try to attract the attention of the Barbies. There are all types of Barbies, President Barbie, the Supreme Court Barbie, Roadworker Barbies. Margot Robbie is Stereotypical Barbie with Ryan Gosling as her Beach Ken. They travel to the real world after Barbie starts developing cellulite and worrying about death. Ken learns about patriarchy in the real world, especially from the clever corporate types who affect an image of equality but use this as a cover to carry on in the old manner. Ken returns to Barbieland intent on turning it into a Kendom and turning the world upside down. Barbie faces the all male Executive board of Mattel where the CEO (Ken Ferrell) defends his policies but literally tries to put Batbie in a box. . Cutting satire, great humour in a whipsmart script with wonderful fake pastel sets in Barbieland. The themes and set decoration bring Don't Worry Darling and Asteroid City to mind. Kate McKinnon is Weird Barbie who helps Stereotypical Barbie to solve her personal problems and to battle against the Kendom. I'll have to see this again. I reckon to properly appreciate all the jokes, irony and satire. Greta Gerwig takes no prisoners as she Directs and Co-Writes (with Noah Baumbach) this comic masterpiece. 9/10.",1
"As most are saying the casting was great. The costumes were awesome. Barbie land set design was on point. The story could have been so much better. It started out fine but dragged in the middle. It became preachy. We know, we live it everyday. Mention patriarchy and move on. I thought it would have been nice to show both sides working together equally in the end. It might not have been realistic but we would have left the theater with a smile. I was not alone leaving the theater thinking what was that all about. I did not see too many children in the theater which was good because it would have been way over their head.",1
"This movie was a massive let down. It was never really funny and just kept pushing political issues in my face. I don't care about politics when I'm watching a movie, and I expect a well written story. This film is just bad, and I was actually interested in it. I had high expectations for this film and I think it did not deliver. It's not a valid social commentary because it does not prove there even is a patriarchy and give an example in real life. Actions speak louder than words and this movie is so overrated that I created an account just to leave a bad review. What did I even see in this film? It's a BARBIE MOVIE.",0
"Very good movie Ryan acting is very nice also Margarot . I haven't totally watched this movie but anyway it's good upto I saw this.greta gerwig movies always good movies this film is also not exceptional from that she maintained her touch.coming to talk about screenplay gerwig and her husband Noah their combo both are legendary directors their combo is good not only his personal life but also in silver screen.ryan gosling is rarely do these type characters most of his movies he delivers same expression, thinking about his acting I am not fan for him but I like Margarot I am a big fan for her role Harley Quinn.",1
"I absolutely loved the barbie movie, the movie had such a beautiful message and Margot is just exceptional.",1
"Barbie was a big surprise for me, I enjoyed every sip of this delicious pink drink that teleports you to a bright world where imagination is real and reality is just a tiny dreamland nowhere and everywhere. The production design was out of this world and the casting of this movie was perfect, every frame was shot and directed beautifully, in general, the technical aspect was brilliant. Still what impressed me the most was the writing! Greta and Noah wrote a masterpiece film that explores while criticizing the good, the bad, and the ugly in the flaws of human nature in the eyes of Barbie and Kent in their fun adventure in the real world and the imaginary one. What was outstanding in this fun ride is the ability to combine all these meaningful feelings and emotions in one movie in a light sarcastic theme and not forget to present the real issues in our world nowadays and the conflict while analyzing the diverse ideologies that clash in this mess, all of this was done through an objective talented lens.",1
Finally went to see what this billion-dollar-grossing film was all about and...wow...what an awesome movie. I can see why misogynistic men have spoken very loudly against it.,1
My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.,0

this movie is like a firework, starts bright and promising but ends up fading into the darkness.",0
"Greta Gerwig's endlessly entertaining flick isn't the first Barbie movie to be put to screen. However, where other precedents have stopped at princess castles and the magic of women's ballet, her 2023 piece shows every facet of the ubiquitous toy, from her stereotypical ""Barbie World"" to the ""Real World"" implications of Barbie on the feminist and body-positivity movements, and it does so with humor and heartache. This unapologetically-weird-and-all-the-better-for-it film is the cr√®me de la cr√®me of ""franchise"" movies, and has a genuinely moving and empowering message to boot.",1
"Movies are odd sometimes. In this case, I feel like the review I would have written the second the credits rolled would've been more positive than the one I'm watching now, a couple of hours later. But, as I've had time to sit with this one, I can't help but feel my opinion on it... Diminishing.",1
"Entering the cinema with the expectation of a colorful and girly adventure, I was surprised to find that this movie delved into deeper societal issues, transcending its supposed joyful facade. It skillfully addressed complex topics within a simple narrative, which captivated me. Despite its innocent appearance, the film was profoundly moving, evoking feelings of sadness, frustration, and anger. Watching it led me to embrace feminism but acknowledge that men also face their own issues. The movie's creator intended to shed light on the intricacies of being a woman, and the portrayal of Ken feeling left out highlights one of the many challenges women encounter daily in the real world. It made me realize how our society has always been so misogynistically setup.",1
Loved it loved it loved it.,1
"Barbie is such a unique movie, it will probably become a very popular movie, at least a cult movie. Great songs ... it was a musical at times ... great talents. The jokes were embedded everywhere in the movie, the phrases, the T-shirts, the signs. I will have to watch the movie again to pickup on more of them.",1
"""Barbie"" should be the only movie I can give 10/10 this year. Both the rhythm of the plot, the tribute to the toy are perfect. Also, from feminism and women's own awakening to the awakening of self is the perfect theme. The plot in the middle of the movie is also very funny and the musical cooperation makes the whole comedy level of the movie to a higher level. By the way, the clothes, buildings, stage properties is a great tribute to toys. In the video, you can see the different Barbies is or was sold in the market, and each Barbie is very distinctive and easy to identify. Let's hope Mattel releases more and better Barbie in the coming years. I really hope you guys could come to cinema and see this movie.",1
"I went to see this one with my 11 year old daughter, thinking that it would be a movie directed to kids. It's not! Actually, it's one of the best social satires I have seen and many jokes and references will be difficult or even impossible to understand for kids. They'll still be having a good time, but it's the adults that are actually in for the big treat. I absolutely loved it and recommend this to everyone who loves a clever satire with a lot of heart and mesmerizing cinematography.",1
"Last year I was appointed to a department hiring committee for an important position. When a colleague asked me who else was on the committee, she scoffed at the gender composition. Even though our department is half women, the hiring committee was nearly all men. I hadn't noticed until she mentioned it. What else don't I notice?",1
"Eric's Grade: A-
2023's 'Barbie' from writer/director Greta Gerwig has blown expectations out of the water, and not only become the highest grossing film of the year, but has captured the zeitgeist to become a veritable cultural phenomenon. The film is a fantasy comedy starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling with significant supporting roles going to America Ferrera, Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Rhea Perlman and Will Ferrell. The movie is co-written by Gerwig's partner Noah Baumbach. There have been more than a few animated 'Barbie' films, but this is her first foray into live action. As August 2023 comes to an end 'Barbie' has set box office records becoming the highest grossing film of the year, the highest grossing film ever directed by a woman and is in the top twenty highest grossing films of all time.",1
"I came in with no expectations and no idea of the what movie was about... and I was blown away. Under the guise of Barbie's beautiful dreamworld, the movie touches on some very real themes. With that being said, I cried multiple times throughout. The balance between social commentary and comedy was excellent, however. While it occasionally came across heavy handed, that was very much the point and very intentional. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling both do such an amazing job of portraying Barbie and Ken. I will be rewatching to soak everything in for the second time. I highly recommend for everyone to watch!",1
"This movie is nothing like I expected AND I LOVE IT. Greta strikes again with the best combo of comedy and drama. I laughed, I almost cried and it was just the best experience.",1
"This is the first movie I've ever watched that I cannot stop thinking about. The way that it perfectly describes how it is to grow up as a woman and lose your girlhood, while the weight of society comes down at you all at once is insane. Margot Robbie was quite literally the most perfect choice for this movie and I have never had such a sinking feeling in my chest while also loving a movie so so so much. The one problem is that it is so catered to women that the men watching literally just don't understand. The point of the movie, at least what I think is the point, is to show how women are still being put underneath men, but these men watching wont get the same reaction women do. They wont understand how true this movie is and how in a world full of Ken's, they should be an Allan.",1
"If you're expecting a subtle satirical flick, Barbie isn't for you. However, you'll be missing out a quite beautiful and clever movie that talks about womanhood like a few movies do.",1
This is brilliant movie.,1
Barbie sets herself to go to the real world to solve her flat feet and cellulite by connecting with the girl that played with her.,1
"Originally when I went into the cinema my expectations were quite low however I was pleasantly surprised. Everything from the set, the dances, the music, the costumes and the actors were phenomenal. Credit to Ryan Gosling, he fulfilled his role as Ken so well and his interactions with Margot Robbie were top notch. I loved the amount of secret cameos that went into when making this movie. This piece of media will go down in history as it has been so well done and the message(s) in it were very much prevalent. I couldn't be happier, I adore this movie and I cannot wait to watch it again at home.",1
"...and the Barbie movie managed to exceed them. I haven't been this excited to see a movie in a very long time, and after going to see it twice in the theater, I still can't stop thinking about it. The writing was phenomenal, the acting was solid, the sets were fun, and the story was lovely. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me call my mom and invite her to go see it together. It takes a lot for a movie to be able to deliver an important message, be entertaining to many generations of movie watchers, and even make you want to go see it again. I believe everyone involved in the creation of this movie knocked it out of the park!",1
I am a man but watched this movie it's awesome Margot Robbie very beautiful but i like the performance of Ryan Gosling a lot this movie It's full of imagination and it surprises me a lot.,1
"On a comedic level, Barbie is perfect. Obviously aware of trending topics and internet memes, the movie never fails to burst waves of laughter every three to five minutes. Every element in this film will become a punchline at one point or another, including awkward dialogues, exaggerated movements, unexpected responses, the Sex Education trio, John Cena cameo, Helen Mirren's epic one-liner, and much more. One actor to be complimented is Ryan Gosling, who bestows a childly himbo character Ken with charismatic idiocy and amusing lightheartedness, in great contrast to his previous sigma characters like K from Blade Runner 2049.",1
"Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. Its good anyway.",1
"Barbie movie had superb casting, writing, acting, and plot twists. It was a surprisingly cerebral movie with a poignant message on the perils of patriarchy in the real world and the exclusion of men in the Barbie land. At its heart, Barbie is a movie about self-discovery. The movie is much more insightful than I expected and takes a deep dive into the perils of minimizing the humanity of women and men be it in Barbie Land or the real world.",1
"This movie was wonderful. I went in with lowered expectations because I find the majority of big movies don't live up their hype. This was not the case here. Beautiful acting and message without being too pushy. It was very accessible; it didn't pander, and it didn't condescend. The dialogue felt very real and not scripted. SO much fun and tons of funny moments. The only thing I questioned was why the montage at the end didn't include some of the pain and sad moments of human existence. It sort of made Ruth saying ""I can't in good conscience..."" a strange thing to include. I'm hoping this will maybe make it into an expanded version?",1
"Words cannot express successfully how I feel about this movie. I want to first say how important this movie is for women in the industry. As a woman who's dream is to be a filmmaker and being so young this is a monumental achievement in my eyes. This movie has made me excited to see what younger minds can do. It has a wonderful creative voice and a beautiful mix of comedy and respectfully addresses hard topics in a way that I think everyone can benefit from. I can understand how some people find it preachy but I disagree because this is a love letter to women. There are so many things that stuck with me and I will probably remember forever. I am impressed with the amount or detail, creativity, and love that was so obviously put into this movie. Greta Gerwig and the rest of the production team did a beautiful job creating an immersive thought provoking experience that brought me to tears. This is by far Margot and Ryan's best performance I've seen and they deserve all the love for it. The sci-fi references are also a very interesting touch that I didn't expect. I think this is a movie than everyone can take something away from and it is very special to me.",1
"There is literally nothing to not love about this movie. Timing, perfect. Comedy, perfect. Ryan Gosling? Also perfect. Please do yourself a favor and go see this movie or purchase it when it comes out. It's rare to see something that synthesizes nostalgia, the societal journey of growing up (that extends generations) and balances this with comedy. There is a reason this debuted so highly at the box office and I am certain this will solidify itself as a cultural centerpiece for film schools in the future. Not only does it highlight long existing issues that half of the population has to endure, it does so in a way that you feel seen and can see others.",1
"Barbie can offer genuine fun when enjoyed with a partner and a carefree attitude, but I strongly advise against watching it in the cinema. The movie lacks the expected nostalgia that a Barbie film should evoke, and it is riddled with hypocrisy and statements that don't hold true within the storyline.",1
"Barbie it's not just a movie about some dolls and perfection. This movie says a lot about everything. In the first seconds of it I thought there wouldn't be something meaningful. I thought it would be some fun movie just to chill while you're watching it. But this movie is a lot more than just fun. With this movie we can see ourselves in it. It shows how powerful women are. But also how hard it is to be a woman. And not just that. Also our childhood. The barbieland is our childhood. Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one. And I think everyone who watches that film can find a different meaning.",1
Well after long consideration i went out and saw this movie. Barbie is an interesting movie because its fun and clever or a gender bender in a blender at high speed .,1
I was all in for this movie before I saw it. As time went by I got concerned my expectations were impossibly high and I'd inevitably be disappointed. Saw it opening night in a packed cinema all dressed in pink (yes the men too). I laughed far more than I expected and had a damn good cry. My ridiculous expectations were exceeded.,1
One of the most affectionately crafted and truly hilarious films of all time!,1
"The first Barbie fashion doll was released by Mattel in 1954, there have been several straight-to-DVD computer-animated cartoons, but it has taken 64 for a live-action movie to be made. This was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, I certainly couldn't ignore it, directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Basically, the film opens with the Narrator (Dame Helen Mirren) explaining the history of dolls before the introduction of Barbie (a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey) and how Barbie came to change the world. Barbieland is a matriarchal society where all ranges of living Barbie and Ken dolls reside. All the women are self-confident, self-sufficient, and successful, while the men spend their days engaging in recreational activities at the beach. All Barbies hold all important job positions such as doctors, lawyers, journalists, pilots, astronauts, and politicians. ""Stereotypical"" Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives her best life all day every day, while her on-off boyfriend Ken (Ryan Gosling) is only happy when he is with her, and she shows him some attention. Ken seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him to be independent and continue her female friendships. Barbie holds one of her regular parties at her Dreamhouse, which momentarily halts when she asks a question about mortality. The following day, Barbie finds her regular routine has altered, her raised feet have gone flat and she has cellulite. Her friends, including Writer Barbie (Alexandra Shipp), Physicist Barbie (Emma Mackey) and Lawyer Barbie (Sharon Rooney) tell her to visit Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a wise but disfigured outcast who was played with badly, giving her permanent splits and felt-tip pen drawn on her face. Weird Barbie tells her to cure her affliction, she must go to the real world and find the child playing with her. Weird Barbie does offer her the option to take her heal shoe and everything will return to normal but really wants her to take the second option (a parody of The Matrix). Driving her pink convertible outside of Barbieland, Barbie finds Ken stowed away, he insists he is coming with her, and she reluctantly agrees. Barbie and Ken travel by car, by boat, by rocket, by bicycle, by campervan, and by snowmobile (all deliberate cut-out scenarios), until they arrive at Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California. The two cause a stir while exploring, including with their colourful roller-skating gear and blades, then changing into cowboy outfits. At toy manufacturer Mattel, the creators of Barbie, the all-male board members are informed that Barbie has entered the real world. The CEO (Will Ferrell) orders her to be captured and brought to them to be put back in her box. At the local school, Barbie encounters a tween girl named Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) who criticises Barbie dolls for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and attitudes about women. Meanwhile, Ken explores the city and learns about the patriarchal system, mistakenly believing it was all started by men and horses. It is through simple interactions with people that he feels respected and accepted for the first time; with everything he has learned he returns to Barbieland. Feeling distraught by Sasha's comments, Barbie soon meets Sasha's mother Gloria (Ugly Betty's America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the person who was playing with her. Gloria is the catalyst of her existential crisis; she was playing with Sasha's old Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Barbie. Soon, Mattel agents arrive and take Barbie to headquarters. They attempt to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha's help. During the pursuit, Barbie enters a room containing a 1950s home scenario and encounters an elderly lady (Rhea Perlman) who recognises her. Returning to Barbieland, they discover that it has changed dramatically. The Kens have taken over, while Barbies have been reduced to submissive roles, such as maids, housewives, and agreeable girlfriends. Barbie tries to convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were, only to be rebuffed. Barbie becomes depressed and returns to Weird Barbie and her group of discontinued dolls. Gloria gives an inspirational speech about society's conflicting expectations of women, and Barbie's self-confidence is restored. Meanwhile, the CEO and board members are making their way to Barbieland. With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Ken's friend Allan (Michael Cera), a lone and discontinued character, and other discontinued dolls, Gloria repeats her moving words to all Barbies to snap them out of their subordinate behaviours. Ken intends to cement the changes to Barbieland and create male superiority by changing the constitution, allowing men to become President and replace all other roles taken by the women. The restored Barbies manipulate the Kens to fight against each other to distract them from the alterations. The Barbies regain their positions of power but also realise the errors of Barbieland's previous societal system. They decide to make changes, including better treatment for the Kens and all outcast dolls. Barbie and Ken apologise to each other and acknowledge their failings. Ken feels that he has no identity or purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find himself. Barbie remains unsure of her own purpose and identity. She suddenly finds herself in a heavenly place where she encounters the elderly lady again, revealing herself to be the spirit of Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler. Ruth explains that she created Barbie as a toy that represented what girls ""wanted to be""; she named ""Barbie"" after her daughter Barbara. After a montage of home footage of young girls playing, Ruth explains that Barbie's story has no set ending. After the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives bid Barbie goodbye, she decides to become human and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband (Ryan Piers Williams), and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name ""Barbara Handler"", to a building for an appointment, and she enters asking to see her gynaecologist. Also starring Issa Rae as President Barbie, Hari Nef as Dr. Barbie, Shang-Chi's Simu Liu as Tourist Ken, Kingsley Ben-Adir as Basketball Ken, Sex Education's Ncuti Gatwa as Artist Ken, Jamie Demetriou as Mattel CFO, Scott Evans as Stereotypical Ken, Ana Cruz Kayne as Judge Barbie, Ritu Arya as Journalist Barbie, Derry Girls' Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie, Dua Lipa as the Mermaid Barbies, John Cena as Ken Merman, Asim Chaudhry as Warehouse Employee, Ray Fearon as Dan at the FBI, Erica Ford as Skipper, Emerald Fennell as Midge, Lucy Boynton as Proust Barbie, Rob Brydon as Sugar Daddy Ken, and costume designer Ann Roth as the Woman on the Bench. Robbie is gorgeous and perfectly cast as the loveable ""stereotypical"" Barbie going on an adventure, Gosling as the muscly, foolish, attention-seeking Ken is splendid, McKinnon is hilarious as the mangled Weird Barbie, Ferrera is good support, Ferrell is amusing, many other supporting cast members and the cameo performers are terrific, and the voice of Mirren (occasionally breaking the fourth wall) is great. Gerwig and her co-writer/real-life partner Noah Baumbach (Frances Ha, Marriage Story) were given full creative freedom for the script. They are unafraid to poke fun at the Barbie world, including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys, and interesting ideas of feminism, body image, female empowerment, the battle of the sexes, and the human experience. The visuals are sugar-coated and saturated with colour, pink obviously most prominent, with impressive set and costume design, and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs (""Pink"" by Lizzo, ""Dance the Night"" by Dua Lipa) (the original ""Barbie Girl"" by Aqua does not feature?!, there is the new version by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice with Aqua) and fun song and dance routines. It could have been a conventional girly Barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending, but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach, a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy. Very good!",1
"The movie shows the power of women and men. Values equality and shows how patriotism is harmful for both men and women, as it creates unfair opportunities and toxic stereotypes, such as sexism and how you should be as a men. People should pay attention to the movie as it can be easily misunderstood and not taken in the right way. Some people might say that it makes out men to be less valued than women. However, it used a metaphor to show how unfair the world really is , as women in reality are still considered less valuable. This movie does not support sexism and it helps both genders to realize they can be whoever they are and they are enough!",1
"This movie is everything and more. It's comedic, colorful, entertaining, heartfelt, nostalgic, and has such a truly meaningful message that's fit for everyone.",1
"I don't know if I've ever seen anything quite like Barbie, which is rewarding if you ask me, especially since I haven't been this excited for any other release this year. So what did I think of it?",1
"A pink lovers dream really,",1
"Didn't watch the trailer and went to see the Barbie movie, thinking it would be a regular comedy about a doll. I liked the idea of dressing up in pink with my daughter and going to a girly movie. But I was very surprised when I found out that there was a deep meaning hidden in the pink world of Barbie Land! The movie touches on women's issues: being always perfect, managing everything, being beautiful, perfect mothers, cooks, careerists and wives. The movie also shows men who don't know who they are without their women, cars, jobs. I cried, I was moved by the dialogues. I loved the movie! I was especially impressed by the moment at the bus stop, when Barbie sat next to an old lady and praised her for her beauty. The old lady smiled and said: I know :) It was so cute and wise! It made me realize that growing old is not scary if you love yourself as you are. You don't need to chase youth, there is beauty and dignity in every age. I am grateful to the directors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach for making the Barbie movie not only a fun comedy, but also a deep drama about finding yourself and your place in the world. They showed that Barbie is not just a doll, but a heroine who can be anyone and do anything. They also honored the memory of Ruth Handler, who gave millions of girls the opportunity to dream and strive for the best. I think that the Barbie movie is not only a movie for children, but also for adults who want to go back to their roots and find their inner beauty. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves Barbie or just wants to watch a good movie with an important message.",1
"This is a movie that was way overhyped. Everyone kept saying it was so amazing, but when I finally go to watch it, it was not at all what I thought it was going to be. The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.",1
"Barbie is a visually stunning achievement that has excelled at the box office while dividing audiences. On the one hand, Barbie amazes with extravagant practical sets and exceptional performances, but on the other hand, the story and directing feel chaotic and erratic. The target audience seems to be moms who played with Barbies and would bring their daughters to the film. Therefore, some film's themes feel more grown up than expected for a movie about a child's toy. Despite probably not being the primary target demographic, I enjoyed the film, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's performance. They elevated the story and script to the successful giant the movie has become. The casting of Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell was perfect for the roles they portrayed. The sets and production design were some of the most impressive I have ever seen in a film! The story was unfocused and unpredictable but also fun and lighthearted. While I wouldn't say Barbie was perfect, and its themes a little too complex for a movie about a toy, its production design and unique story stood out in an era of remakes and sequels.",1
What exactly is the movie about?,0
"Ryan Gosling as Ken I loved too much, but Margot Robbie as Barbie is perfect.",1
"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.",1
"Barbie (2023) :
Movie Review -",1
"It was nostalgic, hilarious, esthetically orgasmic and very moving. It covered all generations of Barbie, which was my hands down favorite toy as a kid. It also touched on the female experience in a really welcoming, wonderful way. I felt it included aspects of the male experience that are important as well. Awesome soundtrack, AMAZING SETS, and wardrobes. The cast was amazing, the writing was perfect, such an original, unique stroy line. If you're going to criticize this movie for going ""against your political beliefs"" then you don't deserve this movie anyways. Women are allowed to talk about the female experience and Barbie was a great way to do it! I just saw it 2 days ago and I really want to see it again!!",1
It got a 3 because there were a few laughs.,0
"Barbie is a movie about Barbie having an existential crisis! Yeah, that's actually the movie. And it's GREAT",1
"Went into this movie knowing it'd be hilariously awkward. Robbie as Barbie and Gosling as Ken. Also a great supporting cast including Ferrell, Cena, Cera, Ferrera, Liu, McKinnon, just to name a few. It was thoroughly entertaining but a few segments were a bit too preachy on feminism, but that's to be expected when it's a Barbie movie. This film had great costume and set designs and will win Oscars for those two categories for sure. It will most likely be nominated in all the major categories. My only hope is that this destroys Mission Impossible at the box office so we can witness Barbie defeating Tom Cruise. Worth a watch and probably a re-watch once it goes up for rent digitally.",1
"Great actors - except for the young girl, who seemed confused on how to act, but maybe she was just lacking being directed well.",0
"First, I'd like to clarify one thing: Barbie is not an ""Anti-Men"" or a ""Men-Hating"" Movie in any shape or form. Instead, it is a very thought-provoking exploration of contemporary ideas such as Identity, Self-discovery, Existentialism, Ethics, Feminism, Gender Roles, Consumerism, Materialism, Beauty and Body Image.",1
"This movie was not made for younger kids who would understand it's deep meaning and I feel as if that was a heavy marketing flaw. However, I am not someone who judges a movie based on marketing around it, just the product. I can confidently say that this movie is messy, but it's a kind of messy I really enjoyed and would recommend to someone if they are trying to find a humorous, light hearted movie that has a strong message.",1
"Its fully a feel good movie with standard comedies, fantasy and adventure.",1
"The Barbie movie interested me at first. I wasn't expecting anything more than a silly movie with an interesting message, maybe it could've been a great way to show people the struggles of women in modern society, however this movie really disappoints.",0
"I think the significance of Barbie wasn't the fact that it was a fun, joyous, all around well movie. I felt everything. From the point being that women to this day hold such little power. You can't want to be skinny you need to want to be healthy. You need to show off but not too much. Nothing you'll ever do will be perfect to anyone in power. But along with this it brings up the fact that emotions are something everyone can experience and that it's okay, you can be emotional and logical at the same time. It's okay to not know if what you're doing is right. I won't ever know if I was made to do what I want to do. Am I supposed to be an astronaut? Is that what my purpose is? I feel lazy when I see that everyone is out having amazing times and I'm stuck in the same continuous loop. Literally, everything that can make me me isn't actually me at all and the thought scares me. In our world, we want and fight for power yet nothing ever comes of it. And this movie is the most beautiful way to showcase all of the world and what women truly do go through.",1
"In Barbie, there are things that deserve praise. But at the same time, there are a lot of things that deserve criticism.",0
"This movie really is what I needed. The casting is perfect, Ryan Gosling as Ken nobody would've think it would be that good. I really had a fun time with a lot of laughs, yes there is a serious undertone in this movie about the diffference between women&men but it's given also in a fun way. America Ferrera is giving a bombing acting like she always does! Margot Robbie is just wauw, she is made for this role, i'm so glad she got the role and not Amy Schumer as previously requested. I would die to see the movie again for the first time, for now I will just wait for it to come on streaming and will stream it again! We are Kenough.",1
"Whoa I am impressed by all the people grading this movie more than 3....
This is complete waste of time ... story was poor and there is really nothing to understand not even on the 2nd or 3rd level ! No matter what the ""intellectual"" people are trying to find out ! Talking about the perception of the woman or even the way the man are behaving ! Seriously ?",0
"I watched this with my wife who was ready to turn it off after about ten minutes, but I talked her into watching it - ""It'll get better, honey. They'll be going into the real world, soon.""",1
"Was very much looking forward to this movie. It's, unfortunately, terribly written. They needed to figure out how to get all the ladies who don't like Barbie on board so they went way over the top on the ""patriarchy"" at the expense of a real plot and good writing. So many cringe moments (the dancing Kens, Barbie turning into real person, the weird montage at the end) that just didn't make sense. Too bad, a good writer could have made this movie poignant, clever, funny and fun to watch. Instead, the script just pondered.",0
Barbie is basically exactly what we need right now. A hilarious summer blockbuster with a social commentary nuanced enough to allow young ones to enjoy but present enough for you to get something out of it. Margot Robbie is brilliant and a perfect Barbie. Gosling shows off his incredible comedic talent more than ever.,1
To be honest I was surprised at the end of the movie it's truly a classic movie that is funny and relatable great story line and it's a cute film I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. Even kids they had a review saying it's not a kids movie I saw the movie with kids the only reason they say that is because the things in the movie are adult things that kids don't understand or relate to there is only one part of the movie that is a little inappropriate but it not something I wouldn't recommend for to kids to watch it is family friendly and it Is a bast of fun to watch as well don't care if you are a man. You don't like pink this movie. I highly recommend for everyone to watch. There is things in the movie that can relate to men as well truly touching and deep I honestly loved it and it forever will be one of my favorites movies and more.,1
We went into this not knowing what to expect. We are writing this review as two straight cis gendered male and female. It is easy to take it at face value and it to be what you want it to be. But the truth is it does not provide the viewer with a straight answer.,1
There were no highlights only lowlights but that won't stop you going to see this just to find out if I'm right .,0
"I finally had the chance to watch the wonderful Barbie movie, and I must say, it did not disappoint me at all. In fact, it surpassed my expectations! Barbie turned out to be much more than what I initially imagined-it's truly remarkable!",1
"The Barbie movie is a very mixed bag. It tries to appeal to both young girls and adults it seems, but this leads it to be very inconsistent with its humor. Margot Robbie does a fantastic job as Barbie and especially the opening works really well in highlighting the absurdity of Barbie's world, where its houses are all open and have no stairs, and its showers have no water and the fridge is filled with a drawing of groceries. All that works fantastic. But mixed into this is a lot of adult humor and sexual innuendo, which makes for a strange mix. It isn't until after the first act, where the movie tries to be more than just a movie about toys, that it kind of falls apart.",1
"I went into the film having high expectations, the marketing for Barbie has been really effective, I have to give them that. I had also heard good things about the movie from friends and co-workers. So I went to the cinema with my friend, dressed in pink.",1
"This movie was so perfect especially as someone who has grown up with Barbie and was in pure awe of her from birth to the age of 12. I was forced to grow up due to peer pressure when I hit twelve so bye bye Barbie. I always regretted doing that because I wasn't ready to say goodbye but everyone else my age was. It breaks my soul seeing young girls, younger than I was letting go of their childhood so quick, trying to keep up with the older teen trends. It breaks my soul because if I was one of those girls I would be crying for my Barbie while conforming to society. Gloria's speech absolutely rocked my world. I need that tattooed in my brain, Greta is an absolute inspiration to women and girls everywhere. One thing about Barbie is I would not have an education without her. When I started school I refused to do my work unless I was promised a Barbie when I returned home, and it worked. If Barbie had not inspired women so long ago, I would probably not have completed my education as I would have found there to be no point. One thing is that I am sad or is a Barbie movie for one reason only, men will not likely see this. My brother and dad had no interest in even looking at promotion or trailers, there is no way I can get them to see this masterpiece, and they NEED to see this it is so important. If there is one movie that can change the course of history it is this one, as the introduction of Barbie did. I'm so proud and excited for Greta Gerwig and what is to come. As a newly out of school 18 year old my passion is to become a director or an actress, and Greta's work delights me everyday because of Greta, I have a chance. Before Greta's movie, I actually never heard of a female director in film, so it never even came into my head as a possibility before Greta came in. This movie has come at a perfect time for me as I turned 18 last month so this is my kickstart to womanhood, and what a way to start. I ask every woman and girl to watch this and I ask them to drag whichever man in their lives that they can. This movie is the epitome of ""yes"" there are no other words to perfectly signify this. Now, after all the mushy stuff, the humour in this film was perfect, there was never a cringy joke moment unless it was intended that way, and they never put a joke in a bad place. I was slightly worried the album may overshadow the movie, but it was perfect, never took anything away from the movie. Ryan Gosling did a fantastic job because I really believed he was Ken, nothing in me could say ""yeah that's Ryan"". Margot did a superb performance of Barbie, it is hard to play a doll that is perfect yet is experiencing an existential crisis of emotion, she deserves more praise.",1
"""Barbie"" is a movie that is setting all sorts of records, so it's obvious that the film is touching many people. For some, it's the fun of seeing a doll come to life, for others it's the theme of empowerment that make the movie a big hit. As for me, I did like it and thought it was a pretty good movie...but it's not for everyone.",1
"This movie is NOT what I expected at all. I thought it would be your average formulaic movie, but no. This movie is deep. It explores topics such as feminism & the patriarchy, femininity, existentialism, and a lot more. It uses incredible comedy to make its points, and hence, doesn't come across preachy at all.",1
"Before watching it, i thought this movie going to be just a pop corn movie with beautiful cinematography and colors and with good actors doing their job as always really well. But when i started watching, ive got the different idea of this movie, i was expecting more of a Wolf Among Us video game style type of thing. While watching this move i expected more and more from it, but ive got dissapointed in the end that it ended in cliche, no plotwist and nothing original way. Would have been amazing if they made exactly same idea like that Wolf Among Us game. Imagine Barbies and Kens living in our world, but in a dark our world's natural way. If film makers made it this way and nailed it, i would have gave this 10/10. Now im giving 8/10 which is a decent score for this movie, because of its cringe worthy last 30 minutes of the ending or so. Loved the joke in the very end, and loved couple of Matrix easter eggs.",1
"I tried getting tickets for this movie for 3 days, and it was all sold out. But we didn't give up. The sun rose, and determination made me do the longest line at 2pm for a showtime at 9pm. Watching a movie in a third world country while on vacation is hard.",1
"By now, there are no original takes on Greta Gerwig's imagining of the iconic doll. 2023's 'Barbie' was a cultural juggernaut, but where there's lots of hype, there's typically lots of overrated-ness to go around.",0
"A few of my friends saw the movie and really liked it so I gave it a try tonight and was pleasantly surprised. This movie is one of a kind. I've had mixed feelings about Margot Robbie but she delivered a wonderful performance. She was perfect as a life-sized version of the iconic doll. Helen Mirren's narration was well-paced, not overly-intrusive, and she dryly delivered a line that resulted in the audience erupting into laughter as I am sure we were all thinking the same thing as Margot was delivering a touching monolog about 3/4 through the film. The entire cast clicked: Ryan Gosling can play just about any role and his portrayal of Ken is another notch on his belt of challenging, versatile, and memorable performances. Kate McKinnon nailed her part and if there is such a thing as perfect casting, she was perfectly cast. I wanted to present an Academy Award to. America Ferrera when she finished her heartfelt reflection of what it is like to be a woman these days. Finally, the music was brilliantly matched to the mood of the film. I didn't expect the music to be so wonderful and it went a long way to infusing an emotional essence into what otherwise may have come across as a technicolor cartoonish fantasy. I want to see this movie at least one more time in a theater. There was so much going on, I know I missed some things.",1
"Ruth Handler, the inventor of Barbie,had a vision of a grown-up doll that little girls could love. In Barbie's world, everything is perfect, not messy and unpredictable like in the real world. You can dress her and play with her in whatever fantasy you want . In a long scene, Mattel executives are chasing the now human Barbie to get her ""back in the box"" acknowledging its patriarchal structure. Is designed to keep women second class. It does mention but glosses over its role in pushing Handler out of the company, supposedly for tax
violations. One critic noted that Mattel mentions itself no less than 35 times during the film. That said, there are some hysterically funny bits that will appeal particualrly to those of us over 60 years old.",1
I regret that I allowed myself to be swept up by the Barbie hype.,1
"I'm a childfree woman that works in tech (male dominated environments), and I did not like this movie.",0
Amazing to watch and delved into womanhood using incredible references. Weird Barbie was such a humorous touch but every part of humour managed to add to the true meaning of the film. Even weird barbie highlighted how barbie was exploited by some users for their enjoyment using her ridiculing and yet she's seen as ugly despite the true fun and amusement she's brought to the world. Amazing soundtrack aswell though I felt some songs couldn't be heard very well at all. Amazing performance from Margot Robbie but as Helen Mirren said she was the wrong person to cast for sympathy during that scene where she calls herself ugly!,1
"I honestly thought I have to see what the hype was all about but I'd go when the buzz has dies down but after not being able to get the ""I'm just Ken"" song out of my head for a couple of weeks I gave in and I'm glad I did...I really enjoyed it! This movie isn't just aimed at kids in fact I would say it was definitely more for adults funny enough. Ryan stole the performance for me as Ken I looked more forward to his scenes then anything else. He captured so much in his looks and expressions that he totally steals the show and barbie actually felt secondary to me which is ironic as Ken always felt second. It could have been named Ken actually I loved knowing more about him then Barbie. Margot Robbie was beautiful and definitely captured Barbie she is stunning. Will Farrel plays the same character I feel though I love him but anyone could have played his role as boss of Mattel. I would watch it again for sure and I would actually love it if ""I'm just Ken"" wins best song at the Oscars and Ryan gets to sing it. Overall I can't find much wrong with it my only complaint is the real world I found a little bit boring I much preferred the dreamworld. Also the Alan character was great I wish we saw more of him. I definitely highly recommend this movie it's an enjoyable watch and a great pick me up smile on face movie.",1
"This movie is not only an actually funny comedy with an amazing script and good jokes, but a seriously intense story of womanhood, girlhood and motherhood that portrayed how much the patriarchy affects everyone. As a girl, this movie resonated with me and every single line about being a girl in this world hit me hard, but it was so beautiful. I've seen men say that this movie was 'feminist garbage' or 'over-exaggerated' but it honest to god wasn't. Not only this, but while being a movie that accurately represents the feeling of not knowing who you are or what you are going to be (aka girlhood) it was pro-men and not in a bad way. Somehow, a movie so strongly empowering women also gave men feeling and hurt. This made the movie so honest and just good. I could go on for hours about how much this movie means to me, and that it's something with messages that will stick with me forever.",1
I'm a man in his 40's and I know I'm clearly not their target demographic. I went with my girlfriend and her two daughters and they enjoyed it.,1
"The entire film I was thinking ""Literally me."" It is a perfect movie in every way, the choreography was absolutely stunning it was fantastic. This movie beats out Oppenheimer in every way possible, me and the boys pulled up to Barbie excited! Will Ferrell was pretty good too as well as all the actors. The Kens dancing as well as all the horses brought tears to my eyes. Also the best part I have to say is at the very end the Barbie song by Ice Spice it slapped I had to watch the credits just to listen to the song. 10/10 would recommend. This film was perfect in every way down to each and every frame.",1
"I really wanted to enjoy this and I know that I am not the target audience but there were massive plot holes and no real flow. The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all.",1
"As expected ""Barbie"" is A lot of happy fun! üíï Greta Gerwig is a director I've really come to appreciate & LOVE. Greta is one of the most wholesome filmmakers working today. ""Lady bird"" is my favourite coming of age story in film and similarly, I have to say right off the bat-this film is ridiculously hilarious. Tongue and cheek? Sure. Just exceptionally written characters also. The quirks between Margot Robbie (Barbie) & Ryan Gosling (Ken) are just magic together on screen.",1
"The colourful & musical ""Barbie"" is set in the plastic uptopia of Barbieland - a Helen Mirren narrated doll's world of: 'Stereotypical Barbie' Margot Robbie; token Kens like Ryan Gosling (with HIS token Michael Cera) & John Cena; empowered Barbies like Issa Rae & Alexandra Shipp; and 'Weird Barbie' Kate McKinnon - into which existential confusion seeps (with Mattel CEO Will Ferrell) via a portal to the real world (thru America Ferrera (great)). Greta Gerwig directs with striking bright vibrancy, but her co-writing (with Noah Baumbach) is bogged in its 'struggle against the patriarchy' theme (despite a light veneer). It's fun - but with a heavy-handed message.",1
"Everything was just so perfect. The cast, margot robbie is basically my fav person and ryan is also nice.. ig. I love how they added some actors from sex education like emma, connor and ncuti. The design was unbelievably perfect as well, the soundtrack, THE MESSAGE, EVERYTHING. I JUST LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH IT WAS SO FUN TO WATCH. It felt relatable, felt so many kinds of emotions at once which was an amazing and unique experience. LOVED IT GRETA AND MARGOT DID SO WELL!! I also loved how there were so many kinds of barbie's, like transgender barbie, allan which i think is non-binary and more.",1
"Who exactly was this film aimed at? Most of the audience when I saw it were adolescents, and there were numerous (perhaps too many) colourful song and dance scenes, which might have appealed to younger viewers, but also a lot of philosophical debate about gender roles and inter-relationships that would have gone over their heads, particularly as these were delivered at a frantic, garbled pace. There were some good comic scenes, and stand-out performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but as the film wore on, it all became a bit preachy. The message seemed to be about finding self-fulfilment rather than romance. Okay, not every film, or every life, has to end in a fairy-tale romantic coupling, but the emphasis on individual fulfilment within the support structure of the sisterhood seems a little bleak. It also makes nonsense of the final confusing pay-off line of the film.",1
"I really enjoyed this little thing! It is silly, kitschy as hell - BUT! Definitely FUN! Entertaining! Dare I say, perhaps Even... Thought provoking?",1
"Laugh out loud humor, fantastic sets and costumes that contain a wonderful message. I took my teenage daughter and preteen son and we all were incredibly surprised by exactly how much we enjoyed the entire film. I was not sure what to expect but it exceeded anything I could have imagined. While there was an inherently difficult topic at the core, it was handled delicately and with care. Lots of hilarity for the adults but minimal issues that would create discomfort if you take younger kids. My kids have already said they want to watch it again. So do I because I think I will find deeper concepts on a 2nd watch. And the music was phenomenal!",1
"I watched this movie expecting something else, but after the movie was finished I was not expecting so much humor, emotional rollercoasters, and a lot of Barbies with Kens. The last scene where Barbie wants to be a human had me almost in tears. I felt different in the heart as well. The soundtrack was also amazing as well. I just wish that there could be more Barbies for like everyday life that we go through and maybe it can get more sales. If not ""Blame Mattel"" lol. The Mattel jokes had me laughing every time they were brought up. I couldn't have asked for a better comedy movie for the summer.",1
"Oh, where do I even begin? Barbie 2023 is a tour de force that has left me utterly captivated, enchanted, and spellbound. Every moment of this cinematic marvel was nothing short of pure excellence, deserving nothing less than a perfect 10 out of 10 rating!",1
"Barbie is a film that left me thoroughly disappointed from the very first scene to the closing credits. The film's overall execution was subpar, and there were a few elements, in particular, that stood out as particularly frustrating. Firstly, the storyline felt disjointed and lacked depth. It failed to engage the audience or maybe it did but it went nowhere with it, making it difficult to invest in the characters or their journey. The pacing was inconsistent, causing the narrative to drag at times and rush through critical moments at others. Secondly, the two lead characters, lacked the charisma and development necessary to carry the message of the film. Their interactions often felt forced and devoid of chemistry, making it challenging to root for their relationship. Overall, Barbie fell short of expectations in terms of plot, character development, and engagement. It left me with a sense of dissatisfaction and regret for investing my time in this cinematic endeavor I regret inviting my friends to watch it. It could have been a movie with a great message. This film, unfortunately, missed the mark on delivering an enjoyable and memorable experience.",0
7.5/10: VERY GOOD,1
"As I have a strong antipathy toward films based on toys and video games, I wasn't sure I'd see BARBIE. However, I had a free evening and, I'll admit, all the hoopla made me curious. So I kicked off my vacation with a visit to my local theater.",1
"Barbie exceeds all expectations, delivering a self-aware and meta comedy that appeals to both devoted fans and newcomers. The film's profound layers and sharp humor create an immensely satisfying experience, showcasing the best version of Barbie on a grand scale while embracing its wonderfully weird and unique qualities.",1
"It feels like its been some time since a film release has gripped the world quite like the way in which Barbie has over recent weeks/months, with the Greta Gerwig directed box office sensation creating a global phenomenon that has translated to record breaking openings in cinemas, critical plaudits and audience adoration on a scale that is mostly just a dream for Hollywood bigwigs.",1
"Great visuals but the 'plot' felt like a bunch of stale ideas that the writers were desperate to include but hadn't really thought through. A real missed opportunity to take the discussion forward about changing society's gendered expectations for both men and women. Instead the writers chose our existing system - but with women 'in charge' - as the final outcome even though they had a whole imaginary world at their disposal to explore an alternative. This was not a kid's film but it was quite a childish treatment of an important topic. I fell for the marketing campaign though! It it got me excited to see the film and buy a ticket, but the 'bait and switch' nature of the campaign left me confused and disappointed.",0
"I went to see Barbie in theaters today, and it is one of the best comedies of this year.",1
"Barbie is a curious film, and I believe that the high expectations of the general public led to its performance being considered average. The film tries to criticize several things at the same time , criticizing how society puts pressure on women and reflections on self-knowledge, besides that, I assume that at some point someone wanted to criticize large corporations, but all of this gets lost in development and becomes confusing and often it's not clear what the movie really wants to be about, maybe focusing on just one thing or working them all properly would be better. Anyway, the film is fun and manages to get some very loud laughs, and unfortunately this script problem persists in situations that just happen without any development or reason, I hope that in a future sequel this is better worked on.",1
"Initially I wasnt so sure about how this movie would be, and whether it would overly focus on the idea of a Barbie doll, stopping it from extending to a resonant deep meaning. However, I was quickly proven wromg as we see the procession of Barbies life going from 'perfect' to 'realistic' showing us that we really are similar, makimg the movie much more pleasurable (in my eyes) and allowimg us to connect with her, them going to the human world and Ken going back with new ideas further related the movie to the real world as we felt some level of pity for Ken as he had been forced to feel this way for so long but also felt anger and confuaion as to why he was ruining this perfecr world woth clearly dysfunctional ideas, given that he knew how it felt. The ending was very satisfying as it brought closure to the topic at hand and also taught audiences a true lesson about society and the world generally, elevating it from a simple childish movie, without sacrificing the barbie feel with the various, sprinkles whimsical and funny moments which acted as a reset for the tone, without causing you to forget what had happened! A very good movie with a strong, well delivered message.",1
Scoreboard:,1
"This is a masterpiece with little to no short-cuts taken on everything that makes a film great - writing, wardrobe, make-up, choreography, set, acting etc. The cast is incredible. Margot Robbie fits the role of Barbie so well. Ryan Gosling (IMO) steals the show as Ken. I found his performance to be the stand-out. I always love seeing Issa Rae anywhere and I think she should be everywhere because she's so talented. I can't say enough about America Ferrera's monologue rant - the writing of that monologue was spectacular but Ferrera's delivery of it was one of my favourite scenes in this movie.",1
"After months of seeing teasers and trending expectations about Barbie, I walked into the movie theater with my Dad not knowing what to expect.",1
"Barbie is fun, hilarious, emotional, musical, thought provoking, full of fantasy, sometimes over the top. It transfers us to whole new magical world and you will enjoy every single second of it while makes us relate to ourselves and our real world problems, emotions and situations. Filled with powerful performances and soundtracks. A instant classy, Must Watch. Margot Robbie owns the role Barbie. She lives the character. Ryan as Ken is so great. He does really steals the show sometimes. All the others supporting characters and human characters are so good and fun too.",1
"Great film which has a good balance between politics, feminism and film making. It was funny, sad and exciting, with great acting to pull it off. The set was incredible and the dances were amazing which really added to the story line. The ending was perfect and showed how barbie has impacted audiences positively and negatively. Mattel really own the so called bad barbies that they discontinued and it is clear either why they were discontinued but also maybe why they weren't necessary to be discontinued. Overall a great film and good to see with the family, it would be really recommended if you have younger children! They should love it.",1
"I was super excited for the movie since the day they announced it and I've been looking forward to it. I was ready with my pink shirt, popcorn and tickets to the early screening expecting a fun loving and very pink movie.",1
I am a big fan of Greta Gerwig but not a Barbie fan. I got excited by all the promo but didn't know what to expect,1
I laughed a lot! I even teared up a few times. I felt a bit uncomfortable a couple of times.,1
"Barbie was the perfect combination of light weighted fun in Barbieland with greatly timed one-liners, other clever barbie-themed aspects of barbies reality vs 'the real world' and a deep (not so hidden) meaning behind modern society, the patriarchy and feminism.",1
"""Barbie"" is a comedy film based on the line of fashion dolls by Mattel. Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig (""Lady Bird"", ""Little Women"") and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, it takes every opportunity to revel in its amusing premise with a darkly satirical look at gender structure in society.",1
"Okay maybe it was a 9.5 because of two flaws: First was the Will Ferrell character and his board that made their point but then became superfluos. Second was that it is definitely not a kids' movie (although maybe they would see things that I didn't - I mean to be fair, the few kids in the theatre were well behaved so perhaps the movie got their full attention as well).",1
"Acting: 6/10

"""Barbie,"" the film, is an enchanting cinematic experience that is sure to entertain viewers of all ages. It's a vibrant and delightful exploration into the world of one of the most enduring and iconic dolls ever created. Its storyline is compelling and keeps you engaged throughout, making it a truly wonderful movie.",1
"It's an incredibly fun movie. Lots of laughs. Very campy over the top humour. But also surprisingly touching. My favourite scene of the movie is just rather a small quiet moment where Barbie is observing every day life and tells an old woman how beautiful she is. Margot Robbie shines in the lead role. Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don't sleep on Michael Cera as Allan. I know a lot of people say that Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer, but personally I thought Michael was.",1
"Well, scenography is nice, wardrobe is nice and actress are pretty. The plot is non existent and the whole movie tries to be something it's not - a social commentary so it dives in whole other area and topics and fails. I didn't have any expectations coming to the cinema, I just assumed it was light and funny movie but instead I got a speech about patriarchy and men's world. Not to say it isn't but it's not something you would expect from a Barbie movie that was marketed as fun and comedy movie.",0
"This movie is so good. It is existential, funny, childish, and adult at the same time.",1
"This is actually very close to a great movie. It deserves your time and money at the theatres. Remember Lego Movie? How no one was expecting anything from it, labelling it as a cash grab? And it actually turned out to be a thoughtful, clever comedy? This movie is just as good.",1
"The movie is amazing, Margot Robbie gives an amazing performance and the ending is unique and has somewhat of a Truman show vibe for me , Ryan Gosling is amazing as Ken and overall the cast is phenomenal in their roles. However, I feel like the plot is at some places a little bit weak and it feels as though this film sets out on a crusade to educate you on the injustices in the real world and does mainly focus on feminism and issues surrounding that topic but it does also cover topics that aren't specific to feminism. Overall, I do not mind the role of feminism in this story and the mother daughter relationship as well as the whole female focused parts of this movie because it is simply amazing and at the end of the day we have to consider this is a movie about Barbie so all those topics are perfectly acceptable in this movie. For example, if this was a movie about some traditionally boyhood toy you would expect it to embrace that in its narrative. In conclusion, I feel as though this deserves a much higher rating then 7.8 for me personally at least a 8.5 or higher therefore I have decided to put 10/10 so the average is higher and the movie is rated properly.",1
"Everything about this movie was incredible. The casting was on point, the sets are eye catching, the soundtrack is delectable! I can not express how much this movie has impacted my life. After seeing it not once, not twice, but three times it gets better and better every time. This movie is so hilarious while also being profound and thought-provoking. I left the theater crying all 3 times, each time shedding more tears than the last. Watching it with my mother was truly a special experience as I got to see how the themes of the movies impacted her as well. I think about this quote at least once a day,"" Mothers stand still so their daughters can look back and see how far they've come."" I would recommend the Barbie Movie to anyone and everyone!",1
"As a guy who never played with Barbie dolls, I was surprised to be caught up in the enthusiasm to see this movie; I purchased tickets well in advance when they first went on sale.",1
"Rarely have I seen a film that can be so heavy handed with its messaging and at others totally confusing. The script is an utter mess, and I felt sorry for the poor parents that brought kids along to what was very much an adult film. The 'real world' was no more real than Barbieland and can anyone explain the point of Will Ferrells character or why he needed to go to Barbieland.",0
"Another movie based on a famous toy, now based on Barbie dolls from the toy company Mattel; I do not love Barbie toys, but I do not hate them either. The movie Barbie (2023) was surprisingly good with it being funny and having a good message; other than the interesting premise to the movie, there is great casting with Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. Another draw to this movie for me other than the premise and the casting, was the design and the look of the movie looking like a Barbie playset with the look of Barbieland and the amount of pink and the use of life-sized plastic props used like in Barbie toy sets.",1
"Barbie comes to life and is surprised by all the possibilities after a life pre-determined. She goes on an adventure in the real world with new friend Madeline. The film celebrates finding oneself and believing in one's potential, with Barbie learning there is no single path laid out and she has the power to write her own story. The film takes Barbie out of her traditional Dreamhouse setting and puts her in the real world for the first time. This allows her to experience what life has to offer beyond what she was perhaps accustomed to. Visually the film looks colorful and upbeat with a focus on Barbie's journey of self-discovery in a real world setting she's unfamiliar with.",1
"The movie is fun, silly, and entertaining. Saw this in the theater which is the first time I've been in one since 2020 most people including myself for dressed up. Everyone interacted with the movie by cheering and clapping throughout. After the movie was over everyone was so uplifted that chatting in the lobby was actually a thing between strangers. That's a lot to get from a little movie about a small doll. I told my husband on the way home we will have to find a karaoke version of a song that Ken sings but not necessarily the one that Barbie does. Will Ferrell was unexpected and as always completely enjoyable.",1
Decided to pick this from red box for the long weekend.,1
"Barbie begins in a bubble-gum-coloured world of fun, fashion and perfection. Although Barbie is played by dozens of actors, 'Stereotypical Barbie' is played by Margot Robbie. Perfection in Barbie land doesn't last long though, as Barbie must travel to the real world to solve her sudden existential crisis. She meets both friends and foes along the way.",1
"I saw the trailer and knew it would be a pretty fun movie to watch. It was so over the top with just everything (colours, world of women, world of men, horses and lectures) that in the end, all what matters was I laughed tears watching it. And so did everybody in the cinema I went to. The beach fight, Ken's obsession with horses and Will Ferrell on rollerblades.. it can't get better than that. The only issue for me was the end, when Barbie decides to go to the real world. That scene was a bit long.",1
"I am a MASSIVE and lifelong Barbie fanatic. I went in to this movie absolutely pumped. I came out of the movie blown away. Typical of Barbie, she blew me away with the absolute depth of her message. America Ferrera's monologue in Barbie Land had people clapping in the theatre. I appreciated it as a Mother, daughter, sister, wife and human being. The truth bombs she dropped got me right in the feels. I know. You are likely rolling your eyes and balking at the sheer IDEA that a BARBIE movie could be in any way profound. I say to you, you must not REALLY know Barbie then. This really was, if I think about it, in true Barbie fashion. Well done, my lady. Well done.",1
"It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.",1
"The title by no means suggests that this movie was predictable. Greta Gerwig does a wonderful job making the 1 hour and 54 minutes enjoyable for a wide range of audiences (which was originally a worry of mine, as a movie centered around the Barbie doll franchise seemed a narrow area of public interest). Rather, following countless pre-release trailers, interviews, promotions, and marketing schemes, I had a general idea of what the movie could be about. In other words, I was not left surprised or awed by new and unexpected artistic choices.",1
"Fantastic musicals, a brutally honest storyline on challenges and struggles for both genders across the barbie land and our world.",1
"The opening scene parodying 21st Century a space oddacy was hilarious! I like it, clever. It's an idea dropped into the world which changed the society fundamentally. Babies be gone, professional dolls here we come!",1
"THE GOOD ... Its bright and colourful ... Rhea Pearlman shows genuine heart ... Helen Mirren is fine as the narrator ... THE BAD ... I didn't laugh once, this is a complete wet rag as a comedy, in fact it is not better than an epitome of mediocrity in all departments and it is embarrassingly over sentimental in places ... ... The music is dreadful, you can't tell one piece from another ... If this is what studio writers are thinking is creative these days , then the fact is they are wrong and at least as regards Hollywood, AI probably could do better and you should sack the lot of them ... You need to learn that if you write stuff to satisfy the cultures ALL around the world and not upset anyone in the slightest, then you write stuff that doesn't satisfy anyone ... This had immense possibilities, but instead turned out to be a geriatric Barbie who had lost her dentures.",0
"From the opening scenes alluding to the greatest film of all time, this movie was captivating, witty, hilarious, aesthetic, philosophical, surreal, unapologetically feminine and feminist. Just masterful filmmaking that made every minute a delight to watch, and made you look forward to rewatching it. It pulled no punches in criticism of capitalism and patriarchy. I don't agree with Criticism that it was a commercial for Mattel since they clearly gave Greta final edit. Really don't can't think of a bad thing to say. But I do think that this movie felt like a cultural reset, that it has changed movies forever in the best possible way.",1
"As of today's date, I would say this is the film produced by Luckychap Entertainment that I've liked the least, despite a more than promising trailer. Despite a perfect cast (Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling seem to be born to play these roles, and the adorable America Ferrera & Emma Mackey are always a delight to have on screen) + sets & atmosphere that exceeded my expectations, I wasn't convinced by the storytelling at the end. The first half of the film is great, but things get complicated when Barbie & Ken leave Barbieland, and here we fall into the trap of a war of the sexes, when I think it would have been more appropriate to try and raise awareness of the fact that ""domination"" never serves anyone. In short, the film is worth seeing, but I have to admit that given my expectations of it, I'm a little disappointed, even if the costumes/settings/acting are stunning.",1
Very good felt like it dragged a but at the end for me which brings the marks down. But overall a very good film with good and enjoyable characters and plot line. Good aspects of comedy in some moments with a good soundtrack to partner with the film. I enjoyed the scenes in barbie land the most but that's not to say the scenes in the real world weren't enjoyable. It wasn't what I expected it to be in a good way. It clearly didn't have a mainly child audience which made it a lot more enjoyable. I loved watching how barbie and Ken adapted to the real world compared to barbie land and how mainly reacted to things that she can't do in barbie land like drinking.,1
"I loved this movie more than I thought I would!! I laughed, cried, and honestly loved the message. All the niche references made me smile, too!!",1
"The Barbie movie is fun, ridiculous, and surprisingly dense. The production design for Barbieland is a spectacle that must be seen on the big screen to be appreciated. If you like or have nostalgia for ""movie magic,"" go see this film, because the people who made it really handled the production with care. Hollywood went hard here, and it pays off.",1
"This uneven portrayal of a live Barbie doll played by Margot Robbie along with Ryan Gosling as Ken creates a Mattel movie with heart that hits some nice emotional notes. Will Ferrell has the unfortunate casting as Mattel's CEO in a role that slapstick comedy that comes across at odds and does not play well either in the real world or Barbie Land, like an out of place reformed Wile E. Coyote from the old Road Runner animation (1966-73). The opening Barbie Land scenario seems to go on for too long and the intriguing opportunity for Barbie to experience the real world seems too short as well as the divided focus between the real life mother and daughter and their experiences as well as the daughter's feelings which seemed to evolve too suddenly. While the Barbie Land sets are amazingly cute and the acting in Barbie Land had a dazzling sense of toy land fascination, the overall intriguing plot seemed somehow dated and underdeveloped even for young kids today. The movie as a whole had sufficient freshness of style, Margot Robbie's impressive acting, and a dramatic plot sufficient to retain marginal sustained interest to watch the move all the way through to the end to warrant a summer vacation land of entertainment for two hours.",1
"Greta Gerwig Director of Little women and Lady bird did a great job directing movie Barbie. I did not own or play with barbie dolls. Made the whole concept of Barbie very enjoyable and motivational for women in general .Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie, beautiful in appearance, perky by nature. After stepping into reality , Barbie meets strong women ..different Barbie.. There is a Barbie with different labels... women in all fields. Conventional ordinary Barbie is not ordinary anymore. The movie is 1hr 54 minutes. In the beginning it is all about beautiful Barbie and then a beautiful twist to the story with planet earth having Barbie in all aspects and professions of life. I thoroughly enjoyed Ken ( excellent lovable Ryan Gosling) wanting Barbie and seeking for conventional Barbie in now matured Barbie Margot Robbie. Fun, great movie with lots of lessons for empowering women and teaching little girls to step out of beautiful fake kitchens and playhouses and feeding dolls. New dimension to womanhood is beautifully embedded in impressionable brains of little girls and teenagers rushing in pink clothes to feel like Barbie. Great job , Greta Gerwig. Adorable perfect Margot Robbie as Barbie who steps out of conventional type cast beauty. Excellent ensemble.",1
"This movie is set for what women experience it's a movie for the men who say ""What if the roles were reversed"" You can call this a feminist or political movie but if equality is that to you that says enough. This movie should be a reflection of men and women it's not a kid's movie they will not understand it but more for those who grew up watching it and playing with dolls as she was the first girl toy that went outside the mother role she is a role model to many young girls who are now women and a lesson to men who will never understand you can call me a feminist by truly women has it hard ""men hate women, women hate women""",1
"Barbie turned out to be a bit of a letdown. I had high hopes for the movie, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. The story felt forced, and the narrative lacked a decisive direction. There were moments of humor, but it missed the opportunity to be hilariously entertaining. The film could have been much better if they had taken advantage of the potential for creative and imaginative storytelling that the Barbie franchise offers. Despite the visually appealing scenes, the overall execution left me feeling unsatisfied. I hoped for a more captivating and memorable experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of delivering that. It is good entertainment.",1
"No way on earth this was possible but that's the thing it was possible that the actual barbie movie was so inspiring that I just had to make it the movie of my month despite all odds there's like no way I'm hell that it would surprise any one all the hype worth it all the praise worth it and behold all the stars worth it everything barbie is just golden sorry platinum just to be precised in my opinion, it's like am the only one who feels this way but thinking about how awesome all the connections sums up it's just so magical from the story to the history infact just see this movie. Am a feminist so that's all thee more reason.",1
Barbie,1
"This movie is quite a masterpiece in every scope and element possible. It is the best movie I've ever seen. It is true cinema. The last movie i ever saw compared to this high quality film is Scooby Doo 1 from the 2000's, which was the best film of that era, right next to Fight Club. The time when Ryan Gosling said, ""I'm Just Ken"" and Michael Cera just stood there, the audience cheered and my 25 year old Vogue supermodel girlfriend broke out in tears; it was marvelous. This movie is amazing by making me feel like a girlbosser, and it truly made one Barbillion dollars in the box office.",1
Such a an amazing film! There was laughter and tears in the movie watching this made me realise how incredible us woman really are! It's so educational and it's definitely something that my little girls will be watching!,1
"It's a fine, fun movie but will never be a classic one like 2001- or Matrix that makes you want to watch it repeatedly IMO. But definitely not a bad one.",1
"6 only for the jokes, the movie Is really stupid, not for Kids and not Easy undestand with dialogs
Puts a lot of thing together Just to seems fair in gender equality in the worst way that you can Imagine.",1
"Firstly, let's start with what was good about Barbie and move forward from there. The colourful palette, the set designs and costumes were perfect to bring you into a world that doesn't take itself too seriously. Barbie wasn't meant to get all philosophical and it wasn't necessarily supposed to provide us with a point. What it gave little girls is happiness and entertainment value. In the early stages of the movie it undoubtedly had potential to be a lot of fun with a comedic effect.",1
"Don't let people scare you away from watching this movie, especially if you're a woman. It's definitely more deep than I thought it would be, there were some issues I didn't 100% relate to, and some parts I felt were a tad exaggerated- however I loved it! To those people who say it hates on men, etc: you obviously didn't pay attention. In fact, you should have realized that the way they treat men in the movie is there to show how a lot of women were and still are treated in some ways today. Overall, just watch it with an open mind and take in all of the good messages it has- especially at the end.",1
There is first in every thing.,1
"I definitely went in with doubts, as one does with the mass market films of day; but this was overwhelmingly more than good. It was the first actually great big box film I've seen in some time.",1
"This movie was everything I didn't know I needed. Was great to just escape from the world for 2 hours. Truly one of the most fun movies I've seen in a while. Fun from beginning to end. Margot was amazing and so was Ryan gosling. 100% recommend for everyone especially if you're a father to a daughter I think it has a Good Message Emmet for all, but especially girls to be what they want to be, and how they can truly be anything. The outfits and stages were amazing. It literally looks like you were at a toy store. I will be surprised if they don't win anything for costumes. I definitely will be buying this movie when it comes out.",1
"I was amongst the people who thought they saw a majority of this film based on all of the filming stills posted on the bird app in 2022. I still wanted to see it. Something about their perfect neon rollerblading outfits. I saw one preview and wasn't sure what the plot was going to be, I didn't care, I still wanted to see it. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing, but amazing it was. Well done!! Margot really knocked it out of the dollhouse. Ryan I'll never look at the same way way again. This 1980s Barbie Superman is very pleased. It won't be long until the opening dance scene is all over the clock app. I haven't felt so compelled to learn choreography since Michael Jackson's Thriller. Also, girls rule. Sorry, Ken.",1
"Barbie is an anomaly, a force of nature, and could potentially be some sort of trendsetter in ways I can't quite fathom yet. I never expected a good Barbie movie to exist, especially not one that is so poignant and rich with satire, ambition, and intellect. But, this movie isn't just good - it's fantastic.",1
"I haven't seen a movie so funny, energetic, and overall amazing like this one in a very long time! I had somewhat high expectations, due to the good reviews (and the not good ones) and i love Margot Robbie and her acting, she was under-rated in Babylon. I'll just say, that my expectations were definitely reached! While funny throughout this movie is is fully hilarious at times, even if you think it would be some stupid ""all pink and glitter and rainbows"" flick, you'll definitely laugh (and you'll probably love it!). It's insanely funny and honestly touching in some scenes. It speaks a great message as well! Overall, will definitely watch again!",1
I can't understand who are the target group of the film.,0
"Wow. Double and Triple Wow. Has there ever been a movie that a] was talky and intellectual that was the most popular movie in all the world? And b] Had no sex, no violence, no romance, no wisecracking flirty dialogs and was the most popular movie in all the world? I truly think there never has been. In the entire history of cinema. This movie is a shoo in for an academy award best picture. And is far, far, far more talky and intellectual than any prior best movie winner.",1
"Barbie is everything expected of it and so much more, a self aware and meta comedy made for fans and newcomers alike that's also incredibly profound, layered and really funny. It's the best version of itself and just immensely satisfying that the Barbie movie that got made on this scale is so weird and unique.",1
"This was definitely an entertaining movie but it went in so many different directions at times. Also, the product placement and clear control from Mattel takes you out of the fantasy at times. Honestly, it is unique and not something really done before, so it gets points for that. It's a lot though. Just a lot going on, and not all of what was going on was necessary.",1
"What a film! I was ecstatic about seeing Barbie and it definitely exceeded my expectations by far. As much as I was excited, I was a bit scared that the stakes were too high; after all Barbie is an icon and a part of so many people's childhood. For a film like this it's very easy to create something corny, disappointing, or unappealing to viewers. I'm so glad that Gretta Gerwig stepped up to the plate and created an absolute masterpiece.",1
"I'm guinely sad to say this movie fell incredibly flat in my opinion. There was no spark, a film trying to do what it was trying to accomplish needed that spark to make it get it to where it was trying to go! It felt as if it was missing that connection the audience/viewers want to receive and feel from beginning to end, forgetting you're watching a movie, that spark that makes you get lost in the story in a best kind of way. I had beyond high hopes for this film. I was truly ecstatic to see it, and was rooting for it every step of the way... all the way till I stood up from my theater seat as the credits rolled. I had this glooming feeling of confusion(not because I did not get it) and unfulfillment. I literally felt bad for wanting to immediately turn to my sister, whose birthday it was, and ask her what she thought because I knew I'd than have to answer that same question to not only her but to everyone else that was going to ask me what I thought. The trailers and hype around it presented it as if it was going to be a hilarious and powerful satire indie film that would go down in cinema history. Yes it had an incredibly outstanding lineup cast, inspiring director and writers, but it was just not all it was hyped up to be. I'm definitely in the target audience, so there's no judgment that should be passed on that thought, I just wasn't that captured by it. This is all MY PERSONAL OPINION, but I did not find it funny, I literally caught myself forcing laughter at some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny because I felt bad the jokes were just not landing, and I really did want to like it. It felt alittle all over the place at times, and rushed in multiple scenes that felt there should have been more there. Yes, there was alot of great speeches that were moving, but sometimes it felt like there were so many it took away from others and you got lost in all the underlying meanings. It felt like someone was saying ""look over here, now over here, no back over here!"" The cast was good, visually appealing, and unique, but the movie as a whole just felt lacking. There was substance, but it got lost in all the messages and lessons it wanted us to take from it. Not something I would just put on to watch multiple times. It's a ""once is enough for me"" type of film. I got the message loud and clear, I just felt no connection was able to be made the way the story was told. Maybe if we got to explore the characters more and build that connection to feel one with the film.",1
"I struggle to comprehend the hype surrounding this movie. Apart from the political commentary and feminist themes it presents, I find it difficult to see the appeal. While the film boasts a cast of well-known actors and Margot Robbie's performance is commendable, the overall plot seems lacking in direction. Additionally, the quality of the special effects and CGI left much to be desired. The ending, in particular, struck me as one of the most nonsensical conclusions I've encountered. There is one positive aspect I can acknowledge - the movie successfully revitalized the brand and its color scheme for a female audience. This achievement can be attributed to the effective marketing strategy that propelled its success. If you would like, I can help you further develop and refine your thoughts on the movie.",0
Was I expecting more from Greta gerwig? Yes!,1
"If Barbie could've done anything with this movie, this is the best it could've done. Pulled off with comedy, heart, and emotion, Barbie delivers.",1
This movie is excellent. Funny & brilliant throughout.,1
A popcorn movie I define as a movie that I don't need to take seriously or get to invested I can just sit back with my popcorn and enjoy it and that's exactly what Barbie was for me. I really just enjoyed getting into the barbie world and all it's quirks and joys. If your gonna do a barbie movie I believe this would be the best way to go about it. That being said I think there are some parts that I believe take you out movie a little and I felt at some points the movie struggled with trying to send a message. It was very on the nose and whilst that works at some points it took me out of it on others. Character wise I believe the casting was perfect Margot Robbie as Barbie I couldn't imagine anyone else and Ryan Gosling carried the film comedically. The supporting cast was amazing as-well and everyone played their part perfectly. Overall I would definitely watch this again and it was great joy to turn off my brain and just have fun with it :),1
"Barbie is a hot pink mess, that ironically sees world in two dimensional black and white. Aside from Margot and Ryan, all the characters are literal one dimensional bimbo.",0
"Some friends freaking out that I went to see Barbie lol I mean I mentioned I went coz my sister insisted since ages. Anyway the movie was bad. These days, every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that. I wished I had gotten the ticket for Oppenheimer in the same timings as my sister's Barbie show. Other than that, the acting done by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was great so can't take that away from them. They did justice to their roles.",1
"Unfortunately, most reviews that I've read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as ""stupid"". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn't offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.",1
"I somehow managed to convince my immensely macho friend to watch this film with me and boy was it an amazing experience! Margot Robbie added a level of depth to this character that has previously never been shown. Her performance wholeheartedly needs to garner her every award for acting. Ryan Gosling as Ken also needs awards, he was immensely funny and showed emotions at the right time. America Ferreira needs to win an award for best supporting actress, her monologue towards the end was just wow!!! The film has a ton of heart, humor and the ability to make you go from being sad, reflecting life to laughing out loud. I would highly recommend that everyone watch this film, it's quite the experience.",1
"Every moment throught this movie was amazing. From the choreography, to the scenes, to the cast and the costumes and everything in the entire movie, really. The message in this movie made me ball out crying and i still am. It taught me that i don't have to be perfect, or pretty, or always having everything under control. I can be a little bit clumsy at times, or i can cry, or have a bad hair day. It doesn't matter. As long as i'm happy and comfortable in my own skin it's fine. Barbie isn't just barbie. No, she's barbara millicent roberts, she's barbara hangler. She's a pilot, a dancer, a doctor, a teacher, the president. She's anything she wants to be and so can you.",1
Interesting look at barbies world but maybe not enough pink üòÇ. Loved the musical numbers and the star studded cast who did not falter on their delivery. The unfortunate truth of the real world's Patriarchal society is laid out perfectly. Sound track was awesome especially Lizzo. Have to say fun to see all the pink outfits rolling into the cinemas not many icons can have this effect. Sex and the city excluded. Doesn't take itself too seriously and deffinetly falls into the comedy genre comfortably. Will Ferrell is a great addition although I word have liked to have seen more of him. In the end it is Barbie's world.,1
Absolutely AMAZING!!!!,1
"I watched the Barbie movie last night. Overall I would say that it's a very creative dare I say, outstanding, movie. The premise is brilliant albeit kind of uncomfortable with its generalization of gender roles and what I'd like to think were hyperbolic stereotypes. But, I am a guy and I definitely have my blind spots as many know. However I do try to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. After all I do have many capable and strong women in my life that I'm concerned whether they get treated fairly.",1
"Was just okay. The acting is super, ryan makes a super funny and suave ken i think. And margot is a perfect barbie, she ate her role up. !this is not a kids movie! Has many innapropriate things and comments i was not expecting. Most of the humour lands for me honestly, i thought it was cute. The diolouge isn't best but it's a movie about barbie what were any of us really expecting.",1
"I knew going into Barbie that I was in for a visual feast. The trailers showcased the wonderful set design, costumes, and performances already. But I was not expecting how affecting this movie would be.",1
"It exceeded my expectations. Truly an amazing film. Everything was gorgeous, the actors were perfect for their roles, the music was awesome (i'm just ken is top tier), the plot was super interesting, the outfits were amazing and truly connected with barbies through history, which leads me to say that is also a historical movie that shows the different barbies that existed or/and got cancelled through the decades.",1
"I loved the set design, acting and personal development of the characters, the nuance and meaning, but didn't like the rushed storyline. Production obviously invested a great deal in the set design, barbie dream houses, and wardrobes. It was pink everything with blue ""beach"", with a plastic vibe. It was cool how they incorporated the Barbie box and different outfits, something I loved as a child. I also thought TV Barbie was a blast from the past (90s baby here), and learned about other dolls like Midge, Skipper, and Alan. Also... they didn't do poor Midge any justice. She was played by a terrific actress, so there was definitely a storyline missed with her character. I thought Alan was played very well though.",1
"Barbie is really not a good film. The IMDB rating is pretty flattering, although I have seen far worse films.",0
Barbie represents opression of women all around the world ruled by men. Ken represents manhood without capitalism or without a genital... blah blah blah...,0
"I expected this to be a very good movie with some feminist undertones. It ended up being insanely funny, ridiculous, fun, and stupidly entertaining, yet highly topical and commentative. This movie hit on so many topics, patriarchy, capitalism, feminism, even misandry, yet managed to stay consistently funny and wild throughout. It never goes where you expect it to go but always defies expectations. The only reason I don't give this a 10 is for the small section of time where the feminism appears a bit too heavy-handed, and I can see where that would cause some male viewers to lose interest in the message. Other than that, this is the best movie I've seen in years and I can't see any topping it any time soon.",1
"I have never felt move validated as a woman as when I watched this film. It is so beautiful and meaningful while also being witty and funny, this is what a movie is supposed to be. You are supposed to be on the verge of tears and the next minute laughing, it's an experience. Although men will watch this and enjoy it, they won't understand it or how validating it is as a woman to watch. This movie was something I hope every little girl will watch and every woman will watch so she can feel validated. This movie is so meaningful and I hope people will see behind the glitz and glamour and see the sentiment behind it. I'm so happy this movie has been created and I've never watched a film that so beautifully shows how complex it is to be a woman and how the patriarchy damages everyone in it but mostly women. It was deeper that barbie and pink and silly. It's also interesting how the dialogue is from a child's perspective of playing with a doll. It took me back to being little and playing with my dolls and thinking anything was possible and not feeling guilty about liking girly stuff, or wearing pink. So well done and definitely a conversation starter. I hope when mothers accidentally take their daughters to see this expecting something else they come out feeling good about being a woman.",1
The jokes are entertaining and the movie has the just correct amount of dramatic storyline to make it more than an empty comedy.,1
"Barbie provided the ying to Oppenheimer's yang. It was significantly better than I anticipated due to it's artistic filming, fun casting, and plot. I expected a 3/10 and it was twice as nice, coming in at a solid 6/10.",1
"Was absolutely amazing. Barbie came to life, it felt exactly like when I was a kid. It brings a deeper more meaningful message without being too harsh. I love how it brings the 2 worlds and perspectives together, it really got me thinking. When barbie goes to the real word, I truely felt like I could relate, as if it was speaking to me and probably most women out there. It's definitely a movie for those who love as well as hate barbie. Its a 10 out of 10 for me. Everyone must see this to gain perspective, a doll's world so completely mirroring our own. Also, the toys of this movie is amazing, a must see.",1
Barbie - The 2023 hyped film thats really not so good as the high imdb says. Its not worth its rating at all.,0
"This movie wasn't just a plastic fantastic teenage movie, or rather it wasn't at all plastic but rather fantastic, and was actually deep and with a ton of messages and pointers about being a daughter, a mother, a Woman, a human being . I laughed at times, was blown away at times because it really mastered the sparkle and magic of the universe of Barbie, but I was also touched to tears at time- and I left the cinema with a feeling of having seen something important. A thing I actually hadn't expected. This is not just a movie about Barbies, but a movie about starting life with dreams, expectations, innocence, na√Øvet√© and how those things just doesn't always match reality- it's about making choices of who we want to be/ not wanting to be. Barbie can be anything (poor Ken is just Ken- a really relatable feeling being a woman living in a man's world)- do we want to be the product or do we want to make an impact of the product?",1
"Completely forgot to review this, the sets are easily the best they're really gorgeous to look at, the characters are fun to watch and the characters are all really enjoyable. The movie gets a bit preachy but only for one scene, I also think the movie is slightly contradictive as every male character is treated as dumb and arrogant despite them promoting equality. It's done for jokes though so I know it's not meant to be an actual message with the humour, I just think it weakens the messaging of the film, it's still a really really good film the ending is super sweet and meaningful and overall it's a great movie especially considering this is a movie about barbie dolls lmao, I personally didn't find it to funny but I still appreciate it for its charm and most of its storytelling.",1
"Barbie (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Barbie in a perfect world who believes she is the perfect role model for little girls in the real world. When things start feeling off for her in her world, she discovers she may need to go to the real world to set things right. When she gets to the real world, she discovers how wrong she was about being the perfect role model.",1
"First of all, Hi all.",0
"I just watched Barbie, it wasn't offensively bad. It was just weak, and not funny. The feminist rant stuff is unapologetically there, not as frequent as some people are saying, it came across to me like content from an '80s female stand up comedienne, so nothing original, and very dated. The script is messy and doesn't make a lot of sense even regarding it's own internal logic.",0
"Ambitious mess, its not a polished jewel without flaws.",0
"The movie was fun and all and It was horrible the way kens treated barbies I mean I also see how they have been treated by Barbies but they have got too far I also loved when she met that old lady that came with her as an idea in the company and it was funny when she spilled the tea all over herself,furthermore the intro was so hilarious the way those little young (girls\boys) destroyed the baby dolls,in addition I would say that I think the end was kind of bittersweet when she stopped being Barbie and moved to the real world to live with people as Barbara,It's an excvellent movie to watch alone or with family and friends.",1
"Barbie is a really fun movie that all ages can enjoy because while it's colourful and entertaining the main storyline can get emotional at times. The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema, the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances. What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.",1
I feel... Confused? I guess?,1
"I retract my statement, the movie wasn't even whole sixty seconds of good... They were changing concepts every 15 minutes... That is absolutely no message in the movie. All in all, instead of me feel good movie, it was a total field confusion, hatred, stupidity and overall annoying. Ken being portrayed in a bad light was stupid. Showing that the owners are the creators of Barbie were morons who didn't know what was happening is was absolutely stupid. Showing that old lady Outta nowhere was stupid. And come on mid life crisis of a foolish lady mixed with villian Ken like what were they getting at.",0
"Although I had read varing opinions on the film, I hadn't bought into them too much as I didn't want anything to be spoiled. It isn't the standard kind of film i would watch but I found it fun, colourful and heart felt with a sad, honest but important undertone and message. I dont see how embracing Inclusivity, equality, femininity and respecting bodily and mental autonomy is a negative. I think this film will make certain people uncomfortable and easily confused as to the message it is trying to convey but I'm glad they didn't dumb it down for those particular audiences and were brave enough not to pander. My kids loved the film and it allowed for some discussion and reflection without breaking the fun vibe.",1
"I didn't expect this! Saddest movie of all times told with Barbie dolls, jokes and a lot of pink!",1
"I went and watched Barbie with my younger brother, and we both had lots of fun throughout the entire movie, even durkng the more emotional parts. The outfits, music, sets, characters, and everything are super colorful and interesting.",1
I can't believe it. Humans have made a good movie. How is this metaphysically possible? Isn't badness defined as the quality uniting things that humans love?,1
"I really liked this film it is a pretty sensitive topic in a land of fun and rainbows I think it got the message through but had just the right amount of humor it also had a lot of great acting g from Ryan gosling and Margot Robbie I really like this film it's great for Adults and for kids even if the topic flies over their heads although I don't think the acting and the screenplay is all flawless I think there are some things they could've done to make it better for example in one scene when Barbie was in her car driving to the ""real world"" it was really glitch in choppy at least for my theater but I don't think that was intentional.",1
I liked the movie and really enjoyed myself watching it. I did think the feminism was a little too 'on the nose' sometimes. But it's difficult to make a film that caters to all audiences. Overall it was a job well done. The set was beautiful and everything expected from a Barbie movie. Simu Liu and Ryan Gosling were showstealers as rivalling Kens and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast. I was also really surprised that the slogan 'a movie for people who love Barbie and people who hate Barbie' caught the essence. They didn't shy away addressing the controversies surrounding some of the Barbie dolls and Mattel as a company.,1
"For me this is the most pointless movie I've ever watched. I really don't understand where all this hype came from. My expectations were not that high considering the type of movie, but sill I waa not prepared for this -> which is the reason why I leave my first review in IMDB.",0
"Expertly written, perfectly plastic visually, with a strong thematic mix of The Matrix and The Wizard of Oz. BUT! It very much made me think of late career comedy specials from George Carlin; not as fun as expected, but there are zero flaws in the logic of the message.",1
"There are a lot of mixed reviews about this film and I really do not understand the point the people that do not like it are making. Nowadays I feel like we are too insensitive to what actually is happening in the world around us. I've read reviews stating that this movie is too heavy-handed and trying to be feminist and political. And yet Oppenheimer got more reviews and stars despite it being 100% political. It's like the world is doing exactly what the Barbie movie tells is happening. There is a serious divide in the way people approach feminism and it is honestly really sad that people think that this movie is ""Pitting men against women"" and vice-versa. Although I do not agree with the ending statement of the movie, ""And the Kens one day will achieve as much power in the Barbie land as women hold in the real world"", but in the end Barbie land is really just a reflection of the real world, just opposite, in order to open people's eyes to the fact that yes, women are discriminated against still and that they do not hold much power and autonomy in our world even today.",1
"From where to even begin? The movie is absolutely immaculate. The acting is beyond reasonable. I would say that perhaps this Greta's most loved film but that would be an extreme allegation considering the public opinion. The movie roars out of the gate with an inventiveness and energy which perhaps the audience was not all set for. The film spreads its politics explicitly, using rudimentary ideas about the performance of gender, gender inequality and consumerism to fuel the plot and inform its comic beats. You would even forget that the movie is actually, and in essence, about a doll because the plot is quite indulging. What i admired most is Helen Mirren performing the narration, not to forget that the casting was also impressive.",1
"Barbie is a movie that challenges us to think outside the Barbie box. Fabulous concept, an iconic character. By flipping the script and swapping societal roles, it invites us to question the norms and expectations we've grown accustomed to. There is a deeper message tucked away in this pink-tastic extravaganza. This fresh perspective adds a lot of fun to the wild world of gender stereotypes, highlighting the absurdity of these rigid societal norms.",1
I know there's been concern that the movie will be overly feminist because it was written by Greta Grewig. This movie manages to capture the right amount of feminism without taking itself so seriously. The standout performance is Ryan Gosling as Ken; I think he carried his role with the perfect amount of Kenergy. Margot Robbie is delightful as Barbie and gives her much heart.,1
"The movie is surprisingly well written. Yes it is a fluff piece, it's called Barbie after all, but for what it was a lot of thought went into all the little details.",1
I went in to this movie expecting to it to be fun based on the trove a press for it.,1
"I wasn't dying to see this, but I felt like I had to participate in the Barbenheimer phenomenon, and the trailer looked good, so I went. I went in with reasonably high expectations because the reviews were high and it has a good cast and crew behind it. I was slightly disappointed.",1
"First of all its Barbie , it's fun and pink .",1
"The most surprising thing about Barbie is that the joke gets old so quickly. Then, after it stops beating the audience over the head with its obviousness, it settles into a self-assured groove. It's the rare case in which the third act is actually better than the first two. The jokes land harder once it sheds the need to be all things at once - a twist neatly mirroring the film's central crisis moment.",1
"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.",1
"Let me get it straight! People had the choice of watching this film and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, and they chose this?! WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS WORLD?!",0
"Yes. Day by day it becomes more obvious that now the movies are made just because of the income they generate and nothing else. Ok, Barbie itself was not a creative idea, I know. And actually I didn't expect to see something unseen something unique in the first place, all in all it's ""Barbie"".",1
"I think i laughed maybe twice. Michael cera was probably the best thing in the movie and he wasnt that funny here. Nothing made sense, there was a really random depiction of what i think was supposedly to be a stereotypical man but it was like a weird distorted version like a fever dream, just really off but just barely accurate enough to catch. I think it was supposed to be comedic. There was a random like half hour where they pretended only women have certain problems and that somehow realizing that broke the girls from a spell that men had put on them by acting in that feverish dream version of ""manly"". Overall it was just super weird and not that funny.",0
"Give this a miss. Colorful nonsense, with meaningless dialouge, stupid musical numbers and endless Barbie referenses.",0
"First of all, let me say that my score for this movie is 6.5, but thanks to the site, I cannot give this vote.",1
"I wanted to like this movie but it was just plain silly. Maybe it's meant for pre-teens. I can't believe Margo and Ryan needed the money so bad they accepted these roles. Ive also noticed that Goslin puts way too much make up on and a lot of the shots are animated or touched up digitally to make him look younger. He is 43 yrars old. Thiwcis not the type of role for him. Hollywood really needs to step up when it comes to quality. Barbie movie??? I mean, that's just unnecessary. I can't believe some people here thought it was entertaining. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one. Avoid at all costs.",0
"The ""Barbie Movie"" brings to life the beloved doll in a delightful and empowering animated adventure that will enchant audiences of all ages. Directed by a talented team, the film embraces the essence of Barbie's timeless charm while weaving a heartwarming tale that inspires and entertains. From the opening scene, the film captures attention with its vibrant and enchanting animation. The world of Barbie is beautifully realized, boasting breathtaking landscapes, colorful settings, and meticulously designed characters. The attention to detail in every frame adds depth to the storytelling, immersing viewers into Barbie's fantastical universe.",1
"Barbie is a fantastic movie, it's so layered, bold and smart. Brilliant writing, directing, acting, costumes and set design wow. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are amazing in it. Also America Ferrera, what a performance (her monologue in one scene has us gagged in the cinema).",1
"So much garbage. I don't get this movie at all. Let me explain myself. This is the kind of movie you live the movie theater why the heck you wasted so much of your time watching this. What kind of audience was this movie made for? Doesn't look like it was made for kids, nor adults. Just a bit more of the work garbage trying to brainwash kids and change the way things are. Who thought this would be a good idea? Same thing happening with big franchises unfortunately. Margo Robbie as Barbie? Some movies like that appeal to our nostalgia, like Mulan, the lion king or scooby doo to name a few. This one failed doing so.",0
"What could have been a cute concept was overproduced with obvious writer infighting pulling this disaster into all directions. A little girl friendly opening act quickly dissolves into act two social discussion that would leave any little girl bewildered. The family next to us described their three little ones as totally confused and everyone they heard discussing it was very disappointed with this disaster caused by feuding writers or a director who scored hilarious with ""Good Boys"". So, not for kids, and parents should wait for home viewing so they can turn it off when it wears really thin about a half hour in: the time it is realized its just not going to get any better and you turn it off thankful you didn't waste any money.",0
"For sure would be better rated if there weren't so many insecure men missing the entire point of the movie, or rejecting it because it is not the same old narrative that has favoured only them until now. I don't think is ""too preachy"" as other comments say. Is an important message that needs to be tackled more to have a more fair society maybe one day. Even ignoring the message, it had a good comedic approach to not just be depressed by the reality it shows, had great music, good acting, creativity, good visuals, all in all great movie. I like that it didn't have a typical love story ending, which would have ruined the whole point of the movie. A fresh movie that is needed.",1
"When I heard that a ""Barbie"" movie was coming out, I had absolutely no intention of seeing it, never mind watching it in an actual movie theatre. I had every Barbie doll as a young girl in the 60's, even Allen. Barbie was definitely NOT my role model, and I am thankful for the live women who were. My daughter went to see it with friends last week and convinced me to see it, because it wasn't what I would expect. I am so glad that I did not wear mascara! I was in tears laughing yet totally moved by the message. A movie that is both inspiring and funny is truly rare. The cast and the message were perfect. Talk about ""Girl Power""!",1
"Barbie had to carry the weight of everyone's expectations (just what the movie is talking about), and people are disappointed because they expected barbie movie to be amazing, perfect and everything in between. The barbie topic, no matter how superficial it may seem, is not easy to grasp and hard to portray. I think Greta did an amazing job, both Margot and Ryan played their part so well, and speech from America made me cry with few tears, all that was said is what all women feel. Billie's song was cherry on top. An 8 on surface since I thought to myself - why would they include such badly executed cgi, and a 10, because um, it's barbie, it's barbie land... it isn't real life, and men should be glad that it's not.",1
"It is a very good movie, a great movie! The actors are great, the film's making is very good in general.",1
"""Barbie"" the movie must be a dream come true for girls all over the world and some guys too if that's your jam.",1
"The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.",1
"The Kubrick-inspired intro was unexpected but definitely appreciated. It's a funny movie. It's got quirky and clever humor. I like how it kind of makes fun of itself as well, it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's very self aware humor. It's also silly without being annoying or repetitive. This movie is very creative and imaginative. It was a very well made movie where they paid a lot of attention to detail. Especially with all the set pieces, costumes and props. It's cool to see them bring the Barbie universe to life in live action. There's some cameos in this movie that were hilarious. Margot was wonderful as Barbie. Michael Cera as Alan was perfect. I love the guy, great and funny actor. Ryan Gosling kills it as Ken. He's got a great understanding of comedy. Kate McKinnon as weird Barbie was so good, she's hilarious. Everybody plays their part wonderfully. The movie's very colorful, warm and bright. It inspires feelings of happiness and joy. It's a very feel-good type of vibe. There's a standout moment for me when Barbie's sitting on a bench and looks around her and realizes that the imperfect real world is actually a beautiful world. With all of it's good and bad, happy and sad.",1
"I really enjoyed the satirical approach that was employed in Barbie. It poked fun at Barbie World but, also delivers a message of empowerment and individuality. I laughed and was throughly entertained. It's a great movie for mothers and their tween, teen or adult daughters.",1
"I liked how the movie was fun and colorful and had a basic story, if you want to chill and have fun this is the right movie, I watched it after Oppenheimer.",1
"The Barbie movie CHANGED my life. It really flipped a switch in my brain that men DO really just want girls ! Nothing more. And you are worth more than that. You ARE all that, and a man's validation does not have to tell you so. Theyre right, barbie is everything and ken is just ken ! Who knew after everything everyone told me i'm worth more than i know, the barbie movie is what did it. I LOVE this movie.",1
"A very confusing plot, under-developed characters and a haughty attitude to glorify the plastic doll in all possible ways, mixing patriarchy, feminism, women's rights, gender equality, sex etc etc. Mattel did everything they could to ruin a good concept, but I am sorry it's just a plastic doll.",1
I don't think I've been this excited about a movie in a long while.,1
"Barbie is based on Mattel's iconic plastic dolls of the same name. Barbie(Margot Robbie) lives a very happy life in Barbie Land, along with her fellow Barbies, Ken(Ryan Gosling) & his fellow Kens. Suddenly, Barbie goes through an existential crisis that makes her question Barbie Land & the truth of her existence.",1
I went to go see it in the theaters and I wish I saved my money and just watched it at home.,1
"Greta Gerwig hasn't missed yet with a film but this film is her first larger budget film. Similar to The Lego Movie, this film appears to be a harmless, funny commercial with a simple message but also like The Lego Movie, great writing and performances make it a heartfelt film with strong themes and messages.",1
"I loved this movie. I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to go view it, but I was not disappointed. Lots of meaning in this movie that relate to the real world. I feel as if many critics didn't pay enough attention to see the meanings. Even simple things and small scenes or scenes that seemed silly and meaningless, had meaning. I loved the inclusion of real classic barbies as well as discontinued and banned ones. Tons of nostalgia throughout for those who grew up and had barbies themselves. My one thing is that the movie was supposed to be for everyone, but I feel for younger children, they wouldn't understand a lot of the movie. I feel like some could be explained and be a good teaching lesson, but overall more of a young adult movie. Otherwise was great and a powerful, moving, movie.",1
This movie had top notch marketing. So good that I went to see it although I had doubt about whether it will be actually good. At the end I did not like it that much.,1
"As we all know the title of the movie suggest fun, tons of 'cheesy' moments, drama and a lot of imaginations. I entered the theater expecting the same and placed all my expectations low and just go how the film flows. Surprisingly, it has a lot of funny moments in the film, at times 'silly', but it was all understandable and placed creatively and entertaining. Margot Robbie as ""Barbie"" was surely a perfect role of her, while Ryan Gosling as ""Ken"" did the same and he was more funnier as expected! Visual effects were cool to watch and soundtrack was for me, a phenomenal! People do see mixed reviewed after seeing it, but do see Barbie as a film and enjoy its ride!",1
"For me the song ""Im just Ken"" was the best part of the movie. But the whole movie is great. It's a great mix of comedy and some serious topics like Gender Equality with a deeper message. ( :
It shows the problems that all women still have in society. But also the problems of the men, which is good because i have the feeling, that due to the fact that men are paid better and had more rights the society is more focused on the problems of the women in this wolrd and forgets about the mens problems. But this movie perfectly shows us that both genders have problems in this unfair world. Greta Gerwig really coocked here.",1
"I had high hopes for this film and have been looking forward to it for about a year. I was blown away by the level of humor, the emotion, the meaning, everything! Honestly, it should've been called Ken, as Ryan Gosling stole the show. I've always thought that he was underrated as a comedic actor. He was Ken. He owned it. He deserves awards for completely giving himself over to the character. Having said that, the entire cast was awesome. The music was incredible. The set design was perfect. I laughed and cried throughout. I didn't expect all of the feels, but there were so many messages that touched my heart. I look forward to many more viewings.",1
"I mean, Margo Robbie as Barbie just made perfect sense, but I really wanted to see the movie when I herd that Ryian Gosling was going to be Ken, I just thought that would be hilarious and I was right!",1
"This movie is absolutely genius. There are so many reasons why our society needed this movie and all
of it's real life messages. The emotion. The monologues. The acting. The music. Everything was perfect!",1
"This is such a unique film! It was so much fun, and had its sweet moments as well! All the choreography was excellently done. The costumes were amazing! I also loved the take Greta had on barbie, and some real problems women and men face. I truly feel like this was such a special movie- and it does not feel like anything I have ever seen before. It was also very funny! (And that's coming from someone who does not like comedy's) I was giggling all the way through the movie. So sad that this gets so much hate, I just feel like it's such a fun movie that everyone should see. So much fun!! Greta Gerwig has done it again!",1
Being a huge barbie fan I had to go watch this movie and let me tell you it did not disappoint. Started as a fun kids movie but took a. Wry interesting turn with its story line.,1
"I loved this movie. The acting was phenomenal, story line and dialogue were great, the sets and costumes were just *chefs kiss*. I took my mom, who is 70, and loved watching her turn into a little girl again. She kept saying ""I remember that Barbie!"" regarding Midge and Allen. I can see why guys don't enjoy it as much, but the point is, this movie is for women, by women, and very much enjoyed by women. The message is for all though, and I'm sad some people don't get it. Little girls can go and be enthralled with all the colors. There's nothing too overt for them to see. Mostly the movie will go over their heads.",1
I thought that the begging of the movie displayed a great virtue of design and implication that really showed how a movie should be set. The colors and lighting of the th me movie let you knew that you were about to watch a great film that gave the us the movie Barbie. It started out showing us the great actress on the front screen. It showed characters that brought us into the movie and it had amazing colors.,1
"Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie
John Cena and America Ferrera deliver hilarious performances
The movie tackles feminism and patriarchy in a funny and unsubtle way.",1
"The most anticipated summer movie turned out to meet my expectations. The sets,acting,costumes,story line everything was pink magic. It is a very inspiring movie for girls but I think a bit too much feminism and toxicity.",1
"Barbie is a film that stands out by defying initial assumptions, proving that it is not just a silly or ironic production. On the contrary, it remarkably addresses important themes with a lightness and clarity that are truly impressive. The storyline delves into subjects such as self-esteem, the value of friendship, and the significance of persevering in the pursuit of one's dreams. Barbie, the main character, emerges as a role model of strength and determination for young viewers, encouraging them to believe in themselves and face challenges with a smile. Furthermore, the film's high-quality animations and captivating soundtrack contribute to a visually and musically gratifying experience. Barbie pleasantly surprises audiences with its positive message, conveyed in an accessible and enjoyable manner.",1
"I thought the movie was fantastic, fun and a good time with a good message. The acting was great, the music, the colors, the cinematography, story. All ""A"" grade. Only 2 things really coulda been better and even with that I still highly recommend the movie!",1
"The most unpleasant and disappointing film that has come out recently! To be honest, I was waiting for this movie! Because of Gosling and Robbie! I waited in vain. Boring plot, bad music (there's not even Aqua's ""Barbie Girl"" song), poor acting and general atmosphere of the film. And even though it is the highest-grossing film of the year, I didn't like it, like many others. Oppenheimer turned out to be much better, and thanks to him for that! I do not recommend this film under any circumstances. Never. Watch only good movies and don't waste time on mediocre film projects. Good luck to all! Bye!",0
"Barbie was hilarious, emotional and exciting. I LOVED the wardrobe and props - very colorful and exact replicas of what I played with in the 90s. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie - casting was perfect. I especially loved the humor and emotional grasp this movie had on the audience in the movie theatre. This is definitely a feel good movie and I hope they continue the franchise. I have to note that this movie had twists and turns at every corner, in good way! There is a lot of action, dancing and surprise ha ha moments. This is perfect for families and adults really; go see it!",1
"Greta Gerwig's Barbie explores creation myths in Barbieland, a parallel universe populated by Mattel dolls. The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.",1
"Going into the movie, i went in mostly blind and didn't expect much into the way it explored a deeper and more abstract plotline. Cast was star-studded and everything seemed to be in place, nothing off there. However, to me, the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a more serious movie with a straight plotline or being goofy with a more abstract plotline. I think the humor was well-executed, but the movie leaned too much into both sides. By doing that, the potential in the movie if they had picked and focused on one solely was diminished. Excellent individual performances from ferrell, gosling, and greenblatt.",1
"I love that this movie is as others put it ""preachy"". I feel that with the current climate and so many young ladies losing freedoms and not realizing how far women have come in the past 60 years we need reminding how quickly it can all go away, lest young ladies today get too comfortable.",1
Let me start by saying it makes me happy to see a movie that isn't from the MCU or a sequel doing so well at the box office. There is still originality out there. This movie was very funny - the scene with Ken and the doctor in LA made me laugh very hard. It's weird and inventive. It has amazing choreography. So many talented people worked on this. I didn't grow up with Barbies so I'm sure a lot of the jokes went over my head. But it didn't hurt the enjoyment. It even manages to land a sentimental note at the end. I can definitely see this being a movie people see over and over.,1
"The barbie movie is AMAZING. Like perfect cast, amazing references. Like Taylor swift level of references and Easter eggs. It's so clear that it's been made by women (or majority women) all departments, everywhere I hope it wins awards. I've never felt this way for a movie before but it defs was hyped up for a reason. It's a barbie movie made for everyone but it's not like a typical barbie movie (which I still love) it's so much more, once I heard Billie eilishes new song I knew it was gonna be GOOD and in depth with its story line and it was. The whole team and makers of this movie hit the nail on the head. It's genuinely become my favourite movie.",1
I found this to be a mixed bag.,0
"Barbie is a very good start movie-try to popularize the feminism idea to normal people. Many people just lack a point or we can say a chance to touch such idea. After watching this movie, I realized that men all over the world love to be fathers and love to preach. Women, as the party being objectified, are always in the status of the object being stared at. When I saw ""Let me show you"" in the movie theater, all the girls laughed, and this kind of resonance for a long time was very exciting lol. The biggest surprise was the tribute to 2001 at the beginning of the film, which I loved. It is a good moral that civilization evolves when all women wake up.",1
"This movie was a great way to redefine what Barbie stands for teenagers, and adults - as well. It was a great way to open up a thoughtful conversation with kids, and adults about common world problems.",1
"This Barbie movie is a first for me. The first 5 minutes of the film was unexpected and hilarious, where young girls were smashing porcelain dolls into smitherines. Afterwards, when we got introduced to Barbie Land, I was bored. Yes, there were a few quips here and there that were funny, like when the suits in an office building told Ken that he needed a college degree and other inane qualifications to work there, as cover for the patriarchy. The acting was good. Weird Barbie, played by Kate McKinnon, was the most entertaining. The scene where the Kens were battling each other was bizarre and, at the end, I don't understand why Barbie chose to be in the real world, except as a set up for Barbie ll. Barbie's power is in Barbie Land, inspiring girls all over the world for the next millennia. In the end, I didn't care. I bet that young kids expecting this to be a different movie fell asleep too. The friend I was with was even more bored than I was. So what made this movie a first for me? Barbie succeeds on its own terms but... I hated it. That's never happened before. If I hate a movie it's because I think it's a bad movie and I can tell you why it's a bad movie. I can't with Barbie. Maybe I gotta see my gynecologist.",0
"A nice, childish movie deserving around 6 as the rating, but as I enjoyed it mildly and sometimes more than averagely it gets a nice and commendable 6.8 rounded up to 7.",1
"This is just one of the two films that are released on the same day (the other being Oppenheimer). Firstly, the movie itself was good; a few comic jokes here and there along with a few heartfelt moments at the end. But I'm not technically a Barbie fan; I just see something that I fancy on the big screen and watch it!",1
"This movie was such great experience to live. It's a fun, entertaining, deep, and amazing piece of art. It was very funny at times, made me cry other times, and made me feel nostalgic and warm and proud and all of these different feelings. But most importantly it made me think! I really love it when movies discuss topics that matter and shake your ideas a little bit. I loved the cast, the costume designs, the music and everything in between. Margot Robbie is a queen, her acting was amazing and she's just the perfect cast for this role. Also, Ryan did an amazing job and so did the rest of the cast. Judging by the propaganda that surrounded it and the hype around it I didn't have high expectations but honestly I was pleasantly surprised. Also, I have to say that the story of this movie is very very similar to ""Free guy"" the one with Ryan Reynolds but it was done well so I can't complain.",1
"This was a great movie, far more moving than I expected it to be.",1
"Honestly I really have no idea why this movie seems to be so popular. Again honest - I went there just for Margot Robbie (I'm a married 34 year old male, and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time, and arguably the most talented one from my list). And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...",1
"I remember when a 'Barbie' movie was announced thinking to myself what a disaster that is going to be. So I was pretty surprised when the film finally came out and the feedback was glowingly positive for the most part. I don't think the film was as good as some people have made it out to be, but it was certainly a lot better than the concept had any right to be.",1
"I had been looking forward to this movie ever since I found out it would exist. I turned my whole world pink. And then I was sitting there in the cinema hall, bored. Yes, I did like the pink Barbie Land. Yes, I loved how they portrayed the actors as innocent Barbie/Ken/(Allan) dolls in their childlike fantasy world. But what happened next? Barbie faced depression, thoughts of death, cellulite, and flat feet (actually, I kind of liked how they freaked out because of that lol). Well, okay, fine - this could still turn out great, couldn't it? Barbie and her ""obviously pain in the neck"" Ken, who appeared more relatable to me than Barbie herself, embarked on a playful and lovely journey to the ""real world."" The CEO of Mattel kind of saved that real-world experience for me. Barbie meets a rebellious teen girl and her mother in a crisis and takes them back to Barbie Land, where Ken, who figured out that men can also rule the world, turned the pink glitter style into a ""Kendom."" So far, so good. What happened next was just annoying and confusing. I'm saying this as a 26-year-old woman. There were endless speeches about how hard it is to be a woman and a mother. And when Barbie decided to live as a human - the already known talk about how cruel human life can be. The only refreshing thing was Ken's battle and the song ""I'm just Ken."" The ever-popular Barbie turned out to be an aging woman who just can't get on with her life and treats the only person who is always by her side (her Ken) like trash, which was the worst for me personally. I felt like no one in the full cinema hall laughed at all during that movie. And the people left the cinema confused and silent.",0
"I was really excited to see this movie in theaters. It takes a well-loved franchise and turns it into a quirky smash-hit. There is also a lot of racial representation and there is a character who is a wheelchair user as well. I think this movie did a good job portraying mental health challenges as well. The scene portraying a Barbie doll who sits on the couch eating junk food also made me laugh and it was memorable. I remember talking about that scene a lot after the movie. I enjoyed the use of many pastels and the music is also catchy and adds to the plot. However, there are references to death and women's health issues. This movie isn't recommended for younger kids, but it's definitely recommended for older fans of Mattel's famous doll line.",1
"So I headed to the cinema to watch Barbie, the new live-action adaptation of the beloved doll franchise. I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it fell short. Barbie takes us on a journey, with Margot Robbie portraying ""Stereotypical"" Barbie as she leaves her world of Barbieland and enters the Real World. She encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. Barbie doesn't always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. The plot feels predictable and filled with clich√©s, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing. The acting and characters come across as stereotypes (something expected in Barbieland but not in the Real World).",1
"This movie is like an interesting conversation you strike up with a stranger, touching on all sorts of things but never really going deep into anything. I guess you can see it a trigger to discuss gender roles and existentialism with your friends after watching it. Unlike the Barbies though, most people tend to not form a life outlook after one powertalk.",1
"I definitely enjoyed watching it. It was light hearted and fun. However, I do find the asethetic a bit too bright for the eyes. Ironic. I know. Just personal preference. Music too loud at times too.",1
"We saw a pre-screening of the Barbie movie last night. I loved the walk down memory lane and some new facts about the history of Barbie scattered through the film. There were great messages around what feminism really is but also how when one gender holds all the power it's not a good balance. The actors were brilliant and Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken was just perfection. Margot Robbie made the perfect ""stereotypical"" Barbie but took us on an emotional ride of discovery. All in all it was an enjoyable movie with a great script. Great for Barbie fans and anyone who has a connection to Barbie from their childhoods!",1
This movie was fantastic. Leave it to the writers Greta and Noah to handle the topic of womanhood so well. The details on the set were outstanding. It even addresses some of how Barbie was created. Being on the theater surrounded by women watching this film felt like a significant moment.,1
A great film that shows both the hardship of real life and the beauty of life. Great film and unexpected .,1
"This movie was a pleseant surprise. It managed to strike an excellent balance between adult and child themes, and essentially all of the humor lands well.",1
"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, l'm in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",0
"But it is also in its smallest details, from the art direction, costumes, and any technical choice completely thought of referencing all Barbie generations and the like. A soundtrack that will take you from laughing to crying (yes, very musical moments, after all it is a Barbie movie), in addition to the hand-picked cast, Margot is impeccable and manages to express all her feelings, just with her eyes. Greta's direction and screenplay, just amazing, strong, emotional, empowering and very, very feminist, not only for the women who are already fighting for the cause, but to open everyone's eyes to a sisterhood.",1
"Wow. I saw this movie on July 23rd and I've been thinking about it ever since. Right off the bat, the first thing that has to be mentioned is the absolutely stunning and wildly impressive set design. The backdrops, the houses, all of the set decoration in Barbieland is PERFECTION. All of the travel sequences are so fun and beautiful and creative. I would love to believe that Barbie can help usher in a new era, where we can go back to at least having some movie with real honest to god set design in a sound stage, without so much CGI. Set Dec is 10/10",1
"I entered the cinema with high expectations, and they were massively outdone. The movie unfolds in a humorous manner, as lovable characters evolve in the most beautiful way they could. Margot Robbie is truly outstanding, and as a spectator I fully lived the experience thanks to her incontestable talent. As the experiences slowly unwrap, the issues and feelings that are contoured cut deeper and deeper, and the audience gets to experience these emotions in a sincere, beautiful way.",1
Listen as a woman in her 20s I am all for feminist movies but this movie really felt like a disappointment.,0
"This movie made me laugh, and cry. It was a beautiful commentary on sexism and the patriarchy and how it affects little girls, while still poking fun at it all. It also spreads a really inspiring message about mothers. I personally wouldn't show this movie to a child TOO young as there are a few jokes about how barbie's don't have genitals, one bleeped f word, and a few mentions of beer. It was a LITTLE depressing, but overall very inspirational. Despite, of course, the discussion of misogyny, I laughed through the whole thing. It was hilarious. It addressed also how adult women/mothers feel self conscious about not being perfect. It was beautiful and I'd watch again.",1
Such a great movie with a meaningful plot line. Have seen it 3x in theaters. I love Margot and I love America- they are my two favorite characters in the movie. This movie has funny points tied with classic barbie nostalgia and a story that gives words to the thoughts and feelings of millions of women around the globe. I laughed and I cried watching this movie and I could not recommend it more. I didn't know how a movie would go with most of the characters sharing a name (Barbie & Ken) but I don't think it negatively reflects on the movie at all...they really made it work together well. That is all!,1
"Maybe I will be perceived as one of those insecure middle-aged men who is ""terrified"" of women, as labeled by another poster on here, but I assure you, I'm not.",0
"My girlfriend and I went to see this movie last night on the day of release because she was so excited for it. Going into it, I had my doubts... I was pleasantly surprised.",1
"This movie was amazing both in the commentary it set out to say and the jokes. I'm not gonna beat around the Malbui dream house, the casting was on point and the references to some of the more obscure Barbie lore was appreciated. Ken also has some pretty fun scenes as well.",1
"Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.",1
"Barbie is the latest toy being turned into a live action movie and stars Margot Robbie(Suicide Squad), Ryan Gosling(La La Land),Michael Cena(Scott Pilgram Vs The World),Alexandra Shipp(A Dogs Way Home),America Ferrara (Ugly Betty)and Will Ferrell(Elf). Directed by Greta Gerwig the film follows Barbie(Robbie) a sophisticated young doll who notices that she is slowly turning human so she goes to the real world to find her previous owner and to meet the CEO boss (Ferrell) to find out why she is malfunctioning.",1
The concept of a Barbie movie is really unique and got me all exited. But unfortunately to me it delivers the same messages that we keep hearing as of lately.,1
"It is a wonder that a live action ""Barbie"" movie came to be, and it's a wonder how Mattel has let it happen. This is a totally meta movie, so self-conscious. It knows what it stands for, what it wants to say and what it represents. It's a work done by a woman, it's obvious in every dialogue and every frame. Mattel is very supportive of what it says, it's actually really forward of them that they enabled this to happen. Greta took a chance and rather than making just another studio movie, she crafted a masterpiece. ""Barbie"" is all about self-identity and discovery and it's a journey to accepting once self and loving it. ""Barbie"" is the Barbie doll we know and still this movie showcases the effect of her on our lives now. It examines all the good and the bad ""Barbie"" has given to the world. It's a movie by a female director with a clear vision and a clear goal, it's made with absolute love and respect for the source material and with an eye for every minor detail. ""Barbie"" is a movie made by someone who knows the Barbie doll. ""Barbie"" is a funny movie, it really is very funny and so much fun. Margot Robbie is ""Barbie"", you simply believe it. She's given us her absolute best and it shows in every frame. Ryan Gosling must have had an absolute blast with Ken. He simply got the assignment. Their dynamic is a way to examine the gender dynamics of our world. What a movie!",1
"Well, if a film like The Lego Movie can come out and be clever and great, I guess a Barbie film can as well. I will always hesitate when a product receives a film based on it because it just seems shameful in terms of marketing. Audiences will always receive a few diamonds in the rough though, and Barbie is just that. It's definitely the most fun I've had at the movies this year. It's a lot more than just bright colours so let's get into it.",1
"I laughed and cried all the way through this movie as my 80's child heart healed and my midlife heart felt reassured that how I have felt through all these years is has been seen. Greta Gerwig is a genius and I'm sorry for all those who thought this was going to be some plastic-fantastic fun ride and were stuck with the deep existentialism and down with the patriarchy messaging - but this was a masterpiece! My only hope is this movie becomes part of the school curriculum and is studied for years to come. Bravo - you are changing the world Greta! And Margo, Ryan and the cast were absolute perfection!!! 10/10 all day every day!",1
"Any time a movie prioritizes messaging, there's an all too long history of the end result suffering, whether in terms of its storytelling, its general craftsmanship, or both. Broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. Case in point, last year's slasher 'They/them' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. This 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they're terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. More than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it's a little overwhelming - I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. And though I somewhat repeat myself, it's well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves. It's a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve, and there's no possibility of missing it.",1
"I have watched barbie since I was born, I've collected the dolls the dresses and many other barbie themed things. I know all the movies by heart and the songs and I love barbie so when I saw this movies trailer and the marketing I went crazy!! I was so excited to watch it and support this movie.",1
"I went into Barbie with no expectations, only hopes that it would be entertaining, even if the intended audience is pretty young. Well, I was wrong about the age of the intended audience because obviously the intended audience is me and my fellow 80's babies/90's teens! I absolutely loved it and definitely entertained. I laughed, got teary eyed, and even cheered at times. Margot Robbie shined, Ryan Gosling gave me a new perspective on Ken, and the costumes dazzled. The themes, jokes, and one-liners were actually pretty insightful. Barbie Movie is not all pretty fluff and makeup. It's the MOMENT.",1
"Barbie was a huge surprise in both a positive and negative way. On the upside, I was not expecting as many solid comedy moments and stellar performances by Gosling and Robbie. I was expecting the PG-13 rating to be a bit more for show but it is used to good comedic effect on a number of occasions.",0
"As soon as the first teaser trailer dropped on YouTube for Barbie, it captured my attention and admiration for it recreated the ""Dawn of Men"" sequence from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in a very creative and classic way. The hype of that one minute long clip, featuring (my celebrity crush) Margot Robbie who steals the show no matter what movie or role she is in, had me believing that this movie would be phenomenal. And over the course of several months until today, my expectations for this movie got bigger and bigger. This is partly thanks to the Barbenheimer online phenomenon which I followed and watched the both movies on the same opening day.",1
"I loved all the details and give major props to the director. I feel so happy that we have a movie that is so empowering and really well made. Their was a great balence between each scene and captured the childhood vibes I used to feel when I was young playing with barbies/especially adding the over-used barbie with the cut hair and marked face. I loved each character and the message sent is very powerful and I'm glad for it. Really if anyone has anything negitive to say, think first about all the patriarchal movie that exist first, and let us have one slightly feministic movie without starting ww3, thank yew :)",1
OMG! I love this movie so much. What a great movie. I love the storytelling. I loved the plot of the movie and I love the setting. Margot Robbie turned out to be the best Barbie ever. Ryan Gosling made a good Ken. This movie must win best picture for the Oscars very good job.. the movie did made me cry at the end of the movie it was very good and happy ending. The choreography was good and the music is good I just love everything about the movie it is worth watching this movie is the best movie of 2023! And yes I do mean that the last song of the movie made me cry off tears so freaking hard. Thank you Barbie.,1
"What a wildly ambitious, near perfectly executed piece of cinema. Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and company have made one wildly entertaining film. It's both mainstream and experimental, overtly political and intensely silly, sentimental and satirical, heavy and light, and hoo boy is it ever beautiful. It never stops entertaining.",1
"Didn't know what to expect... was pleasantly surprised. Clean humor that honored the struggles of women internally as well as those who feel displaced culturally in the US. Liked that it spoke the the variety of people and our roles in society. Was a reminder those thatsuffer struggle, sticking together, through intelligence, compassion and communication can make the world a better place and can be an amazing support structure. It encouraged acceptance of people with differences, people that don't look like you and challenged the battles over ""what's feminine"" or ""what's masculine"" (after all Barbie and Ken have no genitals).",1
"I went to see this movie without even seeing the trailer first. I'm a 42 yo man and people kept posting stuff about this movie on social media, so when a friend asked me to go watch it, I said yes...",1
Going into Barbie with having little to no expectations at all can be such a delight.,1
"Very well made. Terrific directing, acting and writing. It gets deeper at times, but the best part of it is that it isn't trying to be heavy and ""meaningful"" the whole way through. It has a good balance of the more emotional moments with lighthearted humor.",1
"I heard so much about the movie, thanks to all the marketing and the controversy (not sure what it was). ....and finally watched it. It seemed fun at first. Loved the whole production, the set designs and costumes. But the movie dragged in parts, and it just got worst towards the end. I wish they had a solid and fun ending, but they tried to go a different way, which didnt sit well with me. Don't want to really comment about the feminism empowerment, I am all for it but it was too in your face, and this being supposed to be a light and fun movie, ruined the entertainment for me. Being a women, there are of course many issues faced in reality. But this one didn't really nail it.",1
Dont fall for the 5 star reviews. This movie is extremely boring and goes on without a purpose even if it has it's hard to understand.,1
"Barbie was an extremely fun movie that was entertaining and funny throughout the entire runtime of the movie. The jokes were witty, funny, well-written and did not impede on the tone of any serious moments. Barbie was for sure targeted for kids but made for adults to enjoy just as much as the little ones. The casting was phenomenal, every actor embodied their character, Margot Robbie is dynamite in her role delivering every line with sincerity and real feeling. Ryan Gosling was the epitome of Ken, fun, and lovable but he was also able to sublimely deliver emotions that one would not associate with Ken. With 2 powerful stars you would think that the secondary characters would be unnoteworthy, but Simu Liu, and Will Ferrell command the screen so remarkably, not to mention every other Barbie and Ken, and Allen too. All of this without even mention the cinematography and the breathtaking music which culminates into a delightful story that impressively tackles pretty serious issues.",1
"A word of advice. Don't waste your money and time going to see the Barbie movie. Went with the whole family (including my 12 year old daughter and wife) and they asked to leave before it was over, it was that bad. I think it's been 30 years since I walked out of a movie theater because the movie was so, so bad. I don't know how it's been so successful. Marketing at its best (or worst). It's boring, disjointed, and sexist (to both men and women). It's an unwatchable mess, and by the last 20 minutes we cared so little about the characters, that we just left. It's horrendous. Save two hours of your life and don't bother watching.",0
"Thought i was in for a witty, sugar coat covered comedy in which i would have sang the praises of Robbie, Gosling and the production design team. And while that for sure happened, i also found an unexpectedly deep movie, one that even if maybe at times is a bit redundant with its expression of theme, always find an original way to convey it, and really goes some unexpected places emotionally. Truly special, at times laugh-out-loud funny, and in a couple of instances surprisingly moving. The direction is focused, Gosling's comedic timing is impeccable, Robbie's bravura shines throughout, the soundtrack is one smash hit after the other, and yes, omg, the sets are truly amazing.",1
"I was really excited to see this movie, and I wanted to enjoy it so badly, but it really didn't live up to the expectations. I should also probably mention that I'm a young adult and female, pretty much the target demographic for this movie. I'm also a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's projects - this one just doesn't hit the mark, sadly.",0
"We all have an image of perfection and perfection in our minds. But Barbie tells us from the very beginning that Barbie is more than what we usually see, she can be a woman of all walks of life and all colors, and it catches the audience's attention from the very beginning of the film.",1
"I got into the theater with zero expectations, and I can only say I was very positively surprised.",1
"The Barbie movie was overall highly enjoyable. The costumes and sets were great and added to the Barbie nostalgia. Ken was probably my favorite part, watching him go through the ups and downs of unrequited love, and finally finding himself outside of Barbie at the end of the movie. I even enjoyed the over-the-top portrayal of the patriarchy. It was hilarious. However, I felt the ending fell flat. Maybe they were trying to show how ridiculous the patriarchy was by putting in reverse, but I felt like they acted too dismissive of the plight of the Kens, to the point that it didn't feel satirical but rather like actually not acknowledging them and their voice at all. It felt like in giving women power and a voice they ended up actually mistreating the Kens and laughing it off as funny. Sure, they gave them some minor administrative role at the end, but the attitude when they did it was just so very wrong. Like it ended with the Barbies doing exactly what we complain about men in society doing to women. Not that it happened in the middle as part of their growth. It happened as part of the finale. The final focus of the film. Overall, I highly enjoyed the movie, but the ending really made me leave feeling let down.",1
"Watched Barbie tonight with the missus and we loved it! Such a wonderful message and deep existential concepts that I was not expecting from a toy movie. It's up there with the first Lego Movie in heart, but almost feels like a maturer continuation of it. And thats not even getting into the visual aspects of it! From practical effects to the acting it was all top notch, visually engaging, and incredibly entertaining. To say i had tears at the end of it sounds embarrassing, but when the message. The visuals, and that score hit at the climax, the rush of feelings I got; The memories it unlocked; down to the thoughts if everything my wife's gone through and will go through... it was cathartic and heart wrenching all at the same time. I have so much to say about this movie, but i just want to bask in it for a while. Fantastic movie, I cannot praise it enough.",1
"Every one - man and woman, should watch this movie with an open-mind and introspection about current society. Barbie was one of the most real, complex, insightful, trippiest, thoughtful, and educational videos I've watched in a long time. This movie is not for everyone and is definitely not designed for kids due to the much deeper meaning. To get the full experience of the art of the movie, you have to ready to focus and peel all the symbolic layers.",1
"Is Barbie a shrewd satire? Despite the existence of two divided factions, in this case, men versus women, which is somewhat comical given that the dispute revolves around whether Barbie's message is ""correct"" or not, the film can be appreciated by both female and male audiences. The work addresses highly delicate themes that are complicated to consider in today's society, as they inevitably generate controversy.",1
"I anticipated this movie long before it came out and already watched it twice in the cinema. Greta Gerwig managed to make our wildest Barbie-dreams come true and not only created some of the funniest comedy i've seen in a long time in a movie, but also made me agree so hard with every feminist message she put in the film. Messages that everyone needs to hear - even, or should i say, especially men.",1
***SPOILERS**,0
"This movie made me so proud to be a woman and really appreciate the human experience! It's amazing that a film centered around a toy managed to shed light on the genuine highs and lows of being human, making it a refreshing watch! It was funny, visually stunning, emotionally resonant and engaging. I'm not sure why some have labeled it as ""preachy"" or ""agenda-driven,"" because it merely highlighted the realities faced by women today. If these aspects were challenging to watch, that might have been the film's intent - to resonate with its target audience. I appreciate that the movie reminds us what Barbie's original purpose was, to empower girls around the world! So to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack, it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you weren't the target audience anyway. Highly recommend!!",1
This movie is a cinematic catastrophe that leaves viewers questioning the very fabric of reality. This film takes a seemingly interesting concept and turns it into an excruciatingly tiresome and overhyped ordeal that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.,0
"The Barbie movie had a very easy going start with parties, colors, and making fun of stereotypes. It's all very musical-like untill Barbie asks the question about dying which can be seen in trailer.",1
"I was expecting to hate it but I thought at least with all these millions and millions of people over praising it but alas it's worse than any movie made before it. Literally. Utter trash from the first second with indescribably unlikable characters. The beginning is a silly child's movie only to just turn deadly dull when it reaches the real World. I gave up before reaching the halfway point and just FF to the end to see how this dreadful, celluloid abomination would end but had to give up again before doing that. How anyone could see this once let alone several times has left me flabbergasted and flummoxed to the nth degree. I didn't even crack a smile once. As awful as anything can be. The title for worst movie ever made is completely cemented in my mind.",0
"I loved Barbie as a child, so when my teenage daughter wanted to go see it at the premiere, I was on!",0
"It's like a women's solidarity movie. It was a production in which all men were shown as 2nd class and this was done through a good cast and a well-established company. It's a totally overrated PR movie. Despite all this, the acting was successful. However, the movie did not meet my expectations. Ryan gosling and margot ronbbie are both good actors, but this scenario limited both of their abilities. In my opinion, product placement and advertisements were also over exaggerated. It was like the longest commercial I've ever seen in my life. I can say that I counted the minutes, especially for the last half hour of the movie to end, it was not a movie worth all this expectation.",0
"I found this movie one of the more entertaining movies I have seen in some time. I didn't know what to expect and started out thinking when we were in Barbie Land how are they going to make this interesting for the next hour and 1/2. I found out and was pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns I didn't expect. When Barbie ends up in the 'real world' it goes from entertaining to interesting and unexpected. Margo is perfect as Barbie, Ryan as Ken is over the top and to be enjoyed. What I haven't read and am a little disappointed by is the failure to recognize how good America Ferrerra and Ariana Greenblatt were. Totally enjoyed their screen time as well. Don't event get me started on Kate McKinnon as 'weird' Barbie. I was one of those children that actually melted Barbie's hair in my bedroom closet and equally defaced and marked her with indelible markers. Didn't mean I didn't love her, was just precocious.",1
"The Barbie movie was unexpected. It was a colorful and clever ride in the cinema. I was not expecting all the deep emotions that the film gave. Life is not all about perfection, which a lot of people wants to constantly achieve these days, imperfections is what identifies us and that's okay.",1
Greta Gerwig's Barbie is perhaps one of the most ambitious film in recent history. The fact that a filmmaker decides to make a film on such an idea which is equally popular and problematic is brave.,1
"Honestly Barbie turned out to be a pretty good film, the concept was already a good one and the execution was really good. The movie did feel a bit long though, a few scenes that felt dragged out. I like the mother and daughter, they were like the audience's soul within the movie.",1
"I didn't know how many points to give it but I give it a 10 because I have no negatives, I went to watch this movie at the premiere and it was great. The actors did a great job wow! The outfits were also on point. And the easter eggs to Barbies that they were no longer allowed to make was also fun. And the Barbies in the real world was kinda fun how they did was really well done.

"Every fiber of my being insisted I not watch this movie. However, I just know that it's one of the films that will show up on IMDb's 2024 Oscar Highlights, so if I want to earn that badge, I can't just rate it without watching and reviewing it. Quite honestly, if it wasn't for the pink overload, a good part of the flick was quite entertaining. I thought it a brilliant parody and a shot against crass commercialism, even while engaging in it with all the opening hype in tandem with ""Oppenheimer"" this past summer. Sasha's mom (America Ferrera) had the greatest monolog in the story when she went on about the dichotomy women find themselves in, a no-win situation the way her entire argument was framed. As Stereotypical Barbie, I don't think anyone could argue against the casting of Margot Robbie. I don't know if Ryan Gosling was the best pick to portray Ken, but he did a good job, but I resist thinking that 'Kendom' was some sort of take-off on the word 'condom'. Of course, I could be reading too much into that aspect of the story. So there you have it, short and sweet, and a hat tip to Rhea Perlman for portraying the original creator of Barbie, Ruth Handler, who named the doll after her own daughter.",1
Good movie not a great one.,1
Here's the thing.,1
"As 2023 comes to a close, I'd say ""Barbie"" stands out as the best movie of the year.",1
"It is a philosophical masterpiece. Clever and thought provoking, hilarious and modern. I didn't expect that at all. The constructed reality is as complex as if Morpheus from ""the Matrix"" offered you the third pill which conjoins two worlds. Deserves the hype",1
"In one sense, this film was more inevitable than Thanos. What do you get when you're part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? Barbie and Ken aren't exactly human (they don't even have genitals); they're embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the ""real world."" But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it's a dragon. So how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? I would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only American ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that Barbie has played along the way. I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that. There was so much to explore, and it could have been shown situationally, rather than through heavy-handed exposition.",0
"Come on Barbie, let's go smash the patriarchy!",1
"BARBIE was the pink surprise everyone needed, it's empowering and humorous. I would watch it ten more times and laugh every time. I would change one direction or another for some characters, but even what I didn't like when seen together with these well-written plots and accurate jokes is almost invisible. It was fun, beautiful and very enjoyable at all times, the cast's performance is electrifying Ryan Gosling is a humorous and talented genius and Margot Robbie she is as nice and beautiful as Barbie should be. The soundtrack is beautiful and as compatible as it needs to be. Someone give an award to the visual and artistic director of this film he deserves it.",1
"In this movie you can see deep meaning sense of live, you need to know just little things before or to be open mind and the whole univers will show appear for you. Most of scenes have a hidden or deep mening, i am not going to write too much about movie because i am here to sustain Greta Gerwing and i am very grateful for her because she had the creep to made it. Maybe more director will do movies for our souls not just for action,adventure,etc...",1
"'Barbie' is an allegory that invites us to reject stereotypes, to develop our inner wealth and to find our true being in order to embrace the diversity and complementarity that allow us to flourish personally and collectively.",1
"Now I know a lot of people especially women like Barbie a lot, but this movie was just too cringe to me. The story was weird, the acting was a bit off, not very many characters were likable and it was also very weird seeing Ryan Gosling sing a song in this movie and he's not even that very good of a singer. I don't think this movie should even be nominated for an Oscar for best picture. It's probably likely that it will be nominated for a Razzie for most cringe movie ever. The ending wasn't that great either. Sure we got to meet Barbies creator, but it still wasn't very good. 3 out of 10 for this.",0
I LOVED THE BARBIE MOVIE. It was very empowering and encouraging to young girls then ending is unexpected and kind of sad but the movie did not disappoint I was worried it wasn't gonna live up to the expectations but it exceed the expectations I want to watch it again and again I also love the marketing for this movie it deserves a higher rating. I hope there's a part 2 going into more detail so we get even more context about the choices and decisions or a continuation of the ending I also loved how they put the original barbie creator and inspiration for barbie that was a nice touch But it needed nicki minaj.,1
"I enjoyed the movie about how last time, kids used to play with barbie and showed how they would be like in real life. It also showed that how Barbie can be incharge of their own life in real life and not restricted with doing the same thing every day. Barbie is a very interesting movie, from dolls going to real life and actually expericing life. But it's kinda sad for them knowing that their world is very different from the real world, where men dominates and women works under the men. Overall, the movie was a very good movie and would highly recommend to watch, especially those who love barbie dolls.",1
"Barbie blew my expectations away. I have never seen such a brilliantly written movie that makes me want to immediately rewatch. Every detail was thought of in Barbie's world and the satire of the Ken's and patriarchal society was hilarious and relatable as a woman. The dialogue was perfectly childish (as if children were playing with the barbie's speaking) and intelligent. America Ferrara's monologue about the hardships of being a woman was spot on and every woman in the theater could relate. The movie was fun and heartfelt while also drawing attention to society's imperfections. Men who say this film isn't good or ""anti-man"", is part of the problem.",1
"Barbie, while not something I would typically watch, caught my interest. I watched the trailer and felt as though this would not be a typical kids movie. The humor surprised me as I laughed multiple times. The cameos were great. The main cast was perfectly cast. Ryan Gosling shined as Ken. I was overall pleased with the movie.",1
A good movie with an important message that is delivered in a way that makes it easy to understand and can resonate with alot of people. Hopefully the way they delivered the message leads people to see the issues they depict in the movie.,1
"I didn't expect to like Barbie as much as I did, but I enjoyed most aspects of it.",1
"Yes, this film receives my seal of being a yes film, passing all enjoyment factors. It has a) entertained me, b) made me laugh or cry and c) did not cause me to break the cycle of evolution and retract back into an amoeba. Factor c) may be triggered by rather an overload of cringe, a failure of the Bechdel test, a lack of overall slay, bad child acting or the most important, the inclusion of slander of any of the gorlz (Margot Robbie, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Florence Pugh, Kristen Stewart, Meryl Streep, Paul Mescal, Greta Gerwig, Stanley Tucci, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Lee Curtis, *)",1
"Based purely on having come out of one film and planning to see whatever fit in next, I went to see ""Barbie"" this weekend. There was much I enjoyed about it, but I'd have loved to have know less about it heading in.",1
"Barbie Movie Review
She's a Barbie girl (who is having an existential crisis) in the Barbie world. Life isn't so fantastic. So she decides to head to the 'real world' with Ken because we've got everything sorted over here right?",1
"Barbie is absolutely brilliant! Studio executives would do well to grasp the fundamental reason for its success -- speaking truth to the viewer's subconscious psychology. I have yet to see a single review which acknowledges this, presumably because psychology and political rhetoric (from both sides) are received with equal disdain in contemporary American society -- despite the reality that psychology is a valid modern science.",1
"Barbie directed by Greta Gerwig is one of the most anticipated movies of 2023. From the first photos on set to the huge marketing, barbie promised a colourful set and dreamy background where the pastel aesthetic is a fundamental factor. It delivers amazing performances from the whole cast, Robbie and Gosling with unmatched chemistry, Ferrera's monologue and everybody else.",1
"This is a film that should not have worked. It wants to go from goofy, to serious, to moralistic, to sentimental, all at once. Which is similar to the multi-tone ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"". Both movies try to juggle different tones and themes and both succeed for the most part. One thing Barbie has going in its favour is that it knows its limitations and mercifully clocks in less than two hours. The script explores many aspects of the aura of the Barbie doll and its legacy. This is a fresh topic that alone provides interesting insight. An original premise in the world of cookie-cutter franchise sequels. Both the positive and negative aspects of what the Barbie doll represents is addressed without holding back. Amazingly, even the Mattel corporation itself is lampooned. So the script is not only allowed to address less popular characteristics about the doll, but finds real insight about what Barbie and Ken represent to young kids compared the more mature adult world.",1
I didnt expected ill rate this movie at all.,1
Im a barbie girl in a barbie world. Life is plastic and its fantastic. Really good. Meta. And a fun time with the family. There's a lot more i want to say. Ryan gosling was funny and good and its nice to see asian representation . It's not as funny as i thought it was going to be but it had a lot of meaning. Women empowerement. Greta Gerwig is always a good one and maerogt robbie definitely is perfet for the role of barbie. I cant think of anyone else. I was a little cringing at some people going and wearing pink but overall everyone had a good time and i think familys would enjoy it and its better than oppenheimer.,1
"I am not kidding, the movie was hilarious, self aware, touching, camp, beautiful, it was everything. My friend told me it was rare to hear me laugh so much, next to us was a couple and the bf was also dying from laughter. The ""this movie is not for me"" means that you maybe are close minded, if you go to see anything with prejudice, you will more likely not enjoy it. I think it is fair if it isn't your cup of tea but don't review bomb the movie, there nany famous movies that are not for me but i don't think they are bad. Why can't women, mothers and daughters have something for them? All those 1 star reviews are disgusting. I recommend to put the pinkest thing you own and enjoy the movie, i am glad i watched her.",1
At first. I had no interests in watching this movie. But my friends dragged me along. I do not regret using 1 hour and 54 minutes of my life on this movie,1
"As a huge Barbie fan I was first sceptic, but as the movie trailers came out I got more and more enthousiastic. The movie was a big 10 for me. The jokes, the costumes, the actors, the atmosfere, it is all there!!!! Even the music is so nice with all the extras!",1
"I loved barbie growing up, and even at 42 years old I couldn't wait to go see the movie! I didn't have any expectations because I had no idea how they could make a movie about barbie that's for adults and not kids. I adored Barbieland, but unfortunately they leave it behind so fast and with it they also leave behind everything good about bringing barbie to life in a movie! It got silly, had no storyline, was overly political and woke, man bashing and made men silly, and I really didn't care for the ending which is just as well because it was abrupt and crude.",1
"I knew this was going to be political going in but I thought its Barbie so I could overlook it. But it was too much, I do not enjoy politics in movies, whether it's left or right. I expected it to be more fun, and feel good, and it was for some parts but not enough at all. Ryan was great and so was Margot but I did not understand why Barbie didn't like Ken, it's wildly known that Barbie loves Ken and Ken loves Barbie, it's iconic and it made no sense for everything else in Barbie land to be accurate but not that. Another problem was the writing it was very ""told and not shown"" as well as wordy. The scenery was great as well as the costumes, but the story could have been so much better. Like Barbie and Ken take L. A. on a fun adventure and some self-discovery but it wasn't really like that. The ending was confusing does Barbie want to have a baby?",1
"I found this film to be disappointing and and an overall letdown, to say the least.",1
"Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" is a stunning piece of cinema when it comes to costume and set design which blew me away with. Also had good songs and catchy musical numbers but was not as good as expected. With a film being called ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie was great as usual, but Ryan Gosling's Ken was the one who absolutely stole the show with it being his funniest role to date. Now the first 10-15 minutes were rough to get through for myself with the introduction to Barbie world, which is understandable considering what it is. But then even leading into the ""Real-World"" part of the film some of it still had the cheesy bits that I didn't like. From that point on though I did end up enjoying most of the film and the performances from everyone on screen. Overall, the good moments outweigh the bad ones and it ending up being a good fun/comedy film.",1
"Barbie is a delightful and creatively refreshing comedy that breathes new life into the iconic doll's world. From the moment the film began, I was captivated by its smart and subversive storytelling, which cleverly blends meta-humour with a dash of eccentricity.",1
"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is incredibly anti-climatic. It was one of the few movies that I've ever watched that I wanted to walk away from. I watched until the end to give it a chance, and it was just pure disappointment. The only thing they got right was the marketing pre-launch.",0
"Sorry for the title, militants, please don't cancel me! (seriously, jokes aside)
While the movie is good, I anticipate a lot of memes about overblown cancellations, prejudice, and patriarchy... which I think get a lot of attention from the script. More than was needed.",1
"Firstly, whoever rates this movie below 10 is an empty man or a woman without sense of sensitivity and beauty. This film depicts the harsh truth women must live with, which is that this is "" a man's world"". Not a very pleasant fact when your nature gravitates towards unity, happiness, femininity, not war and power. However, the ending is inspiring and masking the saddening patriarchal reality we are trapped into, therefore you don't leave the cinema being depressed.",1
"First, let me say there are some laughs in this movie and I enjoyed some of the comedy. Absolutely fun for kids and family (minus the sexual innuendos and sexual jokes). Honestly I believe this movie is making money cus of the brand alone. Visually this movie is appealing. Yes. Absolutely. Straight out of the toy stores and out of the Barbie toy boxes. Story wise this movie is a dump. Mediocre at best. Feminist heavy which is fine, but the story itself is what makes it a dump. It makes no sense. If you're expecting a Lego movie or Free Guy type of reveal, there is not one. The humans literally just cross over to ""Barbieland"" and Barbie herself is able to stay in the ""human"" world which is apparently a skip and a jump away from the city. This makes the movie seem like it's Disney channel material and not really Disney theater material. It's a Barbie movie so I wasn't expecting much but to not explain why and how everyone is able to just crossover to ""Barbieland"" is bad writing. The main character draws a sad Barbie and it makes Barbie in the nearby very real ""Barbieland"" sad. Barbie can somehow feel her emotions. So with no explanation why, Barbie is supposed to be a doll but is also real and has a connection to this woman who's works for Mattel and draws Barbie in her free time. Mattel CEO's can also crossover to ""Barbieland"" and it's normal. This side of the story is terrible. Aside from the obvious feminist storyline there is no other story that makes sense. It's all just Disney channel silliness. The final scene serves no purpose other than to serve for another inside sexual joke. So dumb.",0
"Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, is a satirical and surreal comedy masterpiece that subverts and celebrates the iconic doll and her world. It's a small art house film on a big blockbuster scale. It's something we need more. It deserves acclaim for that risk that Mattel, WB, Gerwig and all its Cast and Crew took. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, a plastic perfectionist who struggles to fit in with the rigid expectations of her society. When she is expelled from Barbieland for not being flawless enough, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, where she meets a diverse and colorful cast of characters who challenge and inspire her. Along the way, she learns to embrace her flaws, find her voice, and unleash her inner sparkle.",1
"As far as I'm concerned, the first half of the movie was simply boring to me, and the attempts at humor on that level were just UGH. Yes, the message is fine, though very simplified - men bad, women good. I agree that equality is important, and I liked the conclusion that Kens need to find their own purpose. Of course, I didn't miss the gay undertones with the Kens (flexing on the beach with beers and the Grease-like choreography where a black and yellow Ken give Gosling kisses on the cheeks and then shake it off with a ""what was that"" - I'd gladly pay a ticket for that action üòú), and there's also a gay vibe with Allan and the cubicle guy from Mattel... I also liked Weird Barbie and Ruth. The Mattel board was a very coarse caricature to me.",1
"Before making Barbie (2023), ",1
"I love this movie. I love the music. The acting is wonderful. This is just a fun movie! I love the little details that show Barbie is a doll. From their movements, to the plastic cars. The big chunky braids showing the different hair texture is probably my favorite detail. Journey to the real world is one of my favorite sequences. Using real theater elements gives it so much charm, that just using CGI doesn't. ""I'm Just Ken"" is one of my favorite numbers in the whole movie. It has so much energy. Their movements, and choreography just make me want to sing along. No one else but Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling could have played Barbie and Ken. Give this movie a shot!",1
"Who would have thought that a film about Barbie would be one of the most original, fresh film of recent years.",1
"Barbie, the doll that destroyed stereotypes and taboos to later generate new ones and destroy them again, arrives at the cinema for the first time and does so masterfully. ""Barbie"" is a film that portrays misogyny from the perspective of the famous doll, the script is a biting criticism of patriarchy, internal problems within feminism, family and social relationships, consumerism and existentialism, all full of humor, in some scenes with a lot of black humor and the result is excellent, capturing what it wants to convey to the public. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is magnificent and together with the production design they bring a fictional country full of fantastic and pink plastics. The soundtrack is tremendous, with a list of songs wisely chosen (with some exceptions). The cast is tremendous, Margot Robbie's performance is realistic and sentimental, proving to be the perfect Barbie in all aspects. Ryan Gosling plays Ken with humor and also gives him perfect dramatic nuances. America Ferrara as a working mother achieves a performance to remember, especially for her powerful monologue. Kate McKinnon gives a highly comic performance and an endearing character of a very unusual Barbie. Rhea Perlman pulls off an incredible performance wittily balancing comedy and drama. Ann Roth in a special participation of a single dialogue and a smile achieved a sublime and unforgettable performance. Helen Mirren with a voice acting as The Narrator describes everything with feeling and passion taking advantage of her imposing voice. Greta Gerwig's work as a director is genius, she manages to capture the ideas of the script, gives it her own style and pays homage to movie classics. ""Barbie"" is the movie event of the year, a rightfully earned title for this current classic.",1
"The plot is interesting enough to make you feel interested and intrigued even if you're not a barbie fan or just not a fan of cliches, it has a beautiful meaning behind it and it's the best movie for you to watch if you're a woman . This movie is great , i usually don't watch movies with high hopes but i did with this one and still it surprised me . The marketing crew did an insanely perfect job , the hole mall was wearing pink and it helped people on building the hype for the movie. The whole thing is genius, the performances ( specially ryan and margot ) are outstanding and genuinely really good , the direction is great and the whole soundtrack is fantastic. Final consideration : GO WATCH BARBIE , it's worth it.",1
"I loved the laughs that I got out of this movie! Being able to make fun of yourself makes life so much better! The movie was very meta and definitely knew what it was doing. The feel did give slight first season of the office vibes every now and then, but it hit the message home! The main actors In Barbie and Ken were exactly what the movie needed. Will Ferrell showing up was kinda weird not gonna lie, but he did fit into his ""bumbling idiot in charge of everything"" role perfectly. I would also love to see other men step up and say they enjoyed this movie. It was like sitting through a good roast. We should also listen to the true message, and make way for a more equal world. Even for the stereotypical Barbie's, the weird Barbie's, and every Barbie in between. On to Oppenheimer!",1
"Amazing, touching and Beautiful film. One of the best movies of this century so far, yet to a becaome a Classic for the Costumes, Plot and Amazing original songs that were feature in the film. It's been a lot time that movies weren't this good.",1
"Greta Gerwig brings the fun to the well known toy of generations, Barbie. Based on the trailers and interviews my hopes were high that it was going to be a fun and campy ride in the Barbie mobile. I would say it hit a few speed bumps. Women empowerment and understanding Barbie was spot on. Bringing in the discontinued dolls and ideas was brilliant. I feel the Kens' storyline was were the potholes were. Why can't it be Barbie's world and not so strong on a beating over the head that Ken is nothing. That Ken's only recourse is to take over? That Ken in the end, still isn't supporting Barbie as it should be. That might be controversial and some might say I missed the point, but I want my son to see it and come away with equality not that he should be diminished. If we want equality we need to model what a supportive boy/man should be. Partnership anybody?",1
"Didnt know what to expect going in, but was surprised at how good it was.",1
"I saw Barbie yesterday. It was surprisingly good. I think they did as well as they can with the source material. It's a little smarter than you expect they bring attention to a lot of societal issues still all surface level stuff though they were not discussed in a super meaningful way. However it's more than enough given the audience and kids should be learning a little bit about that stuff because it's important. It's full of a lot of emotion and great acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslin. These two were great and probably the best I've ever seen them act. Movie also has a great message and lessons which is a plus these days when all movies are is just special effects, remakes, and franchises. It was enjoyable and entertaining. However it did not feature the song Barbie Girl by Aqua so 0/10.",1
I have successfully completed Barbenheimer and what a wonderful weekend for cinema it was. Every so often is their polar opposite releases but none ever this big. I saw packed theatres consistently on both days which was an amazing thing to be apart of. It felt very much like the old days of going to the theatres for any movie and the auditorium being absolutely packed!,1
"Barbie opens with an homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey before quickly transitioning to the visually stunning, artificial reality of Barbieland, where the sky is a painting and the food imagined. It's colorful, the set designers display fully realized artistic visions-it's nice to see a movie that isn't over sanitized for a mass audience, a movie that doesn't play it safe. You can see the influences Greta Gerwig wanted to include from old Hollywood all over the place. Margot Robbie is the star as Barbie, fully embodying the perfect Barbie life until cracks start to form in Barbieland.",1
"With exagerated colors as promised, Greta Gerwig shows hers capacity to create a piece that's not like a bait for critics or those who love art cinema, but a commercial movie as deep as its's neccessary for it's time - except for it's publicity and public attraction. Besides it's reputed director, screenwriters, actors, references for great movies and the most popular artists composing it's soundtrack, the movie doesn't crave to be one masterpiece. Its just a regular movie that fulfills its role. Even with some metalanguage and self commentaries, it doesn't reach a self-awareness that makes this worthiest. The same works for it's social commentaries, that use strong words on the dialogues only to cover it's weakness of some social-revolutionary statement of it's own ideology. But that's ok and not something to demand on a dolls movie, right? Tho, the movie still have some high points like it's dinamicity, comedy, sensibility and editing. It will probably won, deservedly, the Oscar for best costume design. It's worthy what it's supposed to worth. It isn't what it selled it was supposed to worth. Very curious to know the film's future: if it will be forgetfull or timeless as Barbie, the doll, has been.",1
"While not seeing previous Greta Gerwig's movies might have been a mistake on my side, starting exploring her filmography with Barbie (2023) was surely quite an interesting choice. Honestly, I was a little scared and worried about finally seeing this film - after so much hype on Twitter and other social media it would be disappointing finding out that the movie is not a 10/10 masterpiece. Eventually, I decided that no matter how bad (or good) Barbie actually is, at least I will have the pleasure of seeing Ryan Gosling's astonishing face (and body) on the big screen. The first few scenes of the film absolutely captivated me with their doll-like, plastic pink aesthetic, showing Barbieland as a perfect, colorful paradise. I have to admit though, once our two main characters travelled to the real world, things got a little cheesy. Of course I didn't expect Barbie to be deep or dramatic, but for me it fell into the family toys-come-to-life movie cliche a little bit too much. However, I really liked the comedious aspect of the film, all the references to history of the Barbie doll and others. I might as well say that Barbie became my new comfort movie, something to watch with your best buds, or even a loved one.",1
"Boring, funny only because Gossling played in it, don't understand how such a boring, even stupid movie made so much money, the people who watched it must be desperate; i have a very good sense of humor and an iq above average and i don't understand the success of this movie; plus, i never saw a good movie with Ferrell in it, and Barbie its no exception, very disappointed i was although i didn't expect much from this movie, despite Robbie and Gossling playing in it.",0
"What a cinematic experience. The mediatic effect that this film is having and will have is beyond imagination. I don't know where to start. I feel like Greta is kind of an underrated director but one of the most unique voices in Hollywood. This film is iconic. Using the character and icon of Barbie to tell and send such strong messages is something that not everyone can do. Throughout the film I was always connecting it to Disney's Soul, due to particular sequences that were so strong and that convey the same message (Barbie experiencing the real life for the first time): life is unique, a beautiful gift that it's worth exploring and enjoying despite its suffering - using this solid base to talk about crucial matters like politics, patriarchy, feminism, life as a woman in all its aspects, all in a really enjoyable, beautifully crafted comedic way. Barbie (and the married writers) manages to unite different kinds of genres (musical - Ryan Gosling is sublime in musicals... you know what I mean -, bits of war sequences and the dramatic layer) in a special way. This movie is near to perfection. The epilogue really adds to that perfection, with a heart-wrenching soundtrack by Billie Eilish and some stunning visuals and another expected brilliant performance by Margot Robbie. It's her year, and she deserves all of it. To summarise the film: I AM KENOUGH!",1
"I went into the theatre thinking this is gonna be a little girls movie, about dolls and weird stuff. I thought it was gonna be a boring almost 2h movie about dolls, but oh boy was I wrong.not only was the theatre almost full on the third day of it airing, it was also: funny, inspiring, sad, and at times pretty confusing. It pretty much all felt like a fever dream, but in a good way. It also contained some jokes that were definitely for the adult/young-adult audience, but they were okay for teens like myself and the friend group i went with. Like, Barbie casually drops the word 'vagina' and Ken is talking about his genitals in a non-direct way, but the intention was still there. Some jokes landed pretty flat, but the big majority was very fun. Also the word 'patriarchy' was used way too many times by Ken (Ryan Gosling) and it felt almost annoying. The movie featured songs by the artists: Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj and unfortunately Ice Spice. The soundtrack was absolutely incredible, maybe exept Ice Spice's song that was only heard at the credit roll, right at the end. We all know the movie was carried by the amazing Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but I'd say Kate McKinnon's caracter and acting
In conclusion this is a pretty good movie, and if you have the opportunity you should watch it.",1
"I cried, I laughed, I dance and I did sing too. What a joyful time I had at the movies watching Barbie. This is a movie to celebrate how diverse and complicated are the humans. The cinematography is a outstanding as well as the production design and the vestuary. The casting seems like made in heaven. I recommend this movie for 11+ years old. And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think. Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken, he does everything in this movie and shines every time he shows up. Margo is a perfect Barbie and got a real sense of the relevance this is going to have.",1
STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * Awful,1
I never have done a movie review because I have never seen one worth reviewing till Now!!!!!!!,1
"This film has hilarious moments and it visually looks good with the set, costume, and prop designs. HOWEVER, the film shoves its agendas down our throats like it's thanksgiving dinner.",1
I enjoyed the film more for its choreography and the characters' sympathy than for the confusing message. Is it that Ken should understand he was created to be Barbie's friend forever? Is it that a man in love must surrender to a second place? I hope I can read the actual purpose of the story from the writers.,1
"Barbie is a film that stands out in many aspects, from its comedic moments to its unique charm. The world it presents is filled with vibrant colors, whimsical settings, lively music, and a sense of fantasy and extravagance. Visually speaking, the film is truly unmatched. The actors delivered commendable performances, with special applause going to Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. However, I must admit that I personally enjoyed the scenes included in the trailer more than some of the other parts of the film. They struck me as particularly funny.",1
I love this film. It's so what we need right now. A bright and happy movie that makes you smile.,1
Went with my friend to see Barbie for her birthday and now we're both having existential crises about being woman and growing up.,1
A beautiful light tale about the development and conditioning of identity and self esteem and how it can lead to stereotypical behavior and dependency in relationships. But also how a person can get the intuition that it feels better to make a choice for another direction in one's life. The first steps in this new direction starts with a new physical sensation in your feet and emotional associations about getting older and dying in the end. Like in 'The Little Mermaid' you have to sacrifice things that were important to you but once you stepped into this new world it feels like being born for the second time. Superb movie.,1
"Me and my friend have been dying to see this film for months, we thought it would be a funny silly movie but its was so much more.",1
I haven't written a review on IMDb before but I felt like I need to for this film.,1
"The Barbie movie brilliantly brings to life the magical universe of Mattel's iconic Barbie dolls, with Margot Robbie's exceptional portrayal of Barbie herself at the forefront. Robbie's performance is truly remarkable, capturing the essence of the beloved character with grace and charm. Her embodiment of Barbie's timeless appeal and elegance goes beyond mere physical resemblance.",1
"I loved the opening sequence of the film and knew it was going to be a fun ride there on out. And it was! It's not ""political"", yes it does talk about the hardships and stereotypes women face, but it's weird that anyone would be upset by that?! The set designs and camp were beyond entertaining and some of the scenes were so out of this world and hilarious. The only reason I don't give it a full ten stars is that I do agree the ending fell a little flat for me, in that I thought everyone in Barbieland would be a little more equal. But, a small miss in an otherwise successful movie. Just go see it!",1
"The movie starts off great, and has hilarious jokes throughout. For me, Ryan Gosling stole the show as he had the funniest lines and scenes. Some folks are mad about the women's empowerment themes, not me. Men have treated women as less than equal since the dawn of time, who are we to complain when they rightfully mock that? I don't mind the shots at the patriarchy, or even the fact that there's not one intelligent male character in the entire thing. What I don't like about this movie is Barbie's existential crisis. It's like they forgot the audience majority are children, and it feels like a pathetic bid for an Oscar. That arc was as off-putting as it was unnecessary. Had that element been replaced with more humor or at least a wholesome resolution, I would've given it a much higher score. They just took it to a place where it's less relatable for the children watching.",0
"Before I start this review, let me start by saying that I used to be a staunch feminist. I'm certain that once upon a time, this film would have been right up my alley. I would have been nodding along with America Ferrera's infamous 30-min monologue in the second act (was it thirty minutes? It felt like thirty minutes). I would have been cheering when the women finally wrested back power. I would have been disgusted at the instatement of the patriarchy in Barbieland.",0
"The Barbie movie is a mixture of comedy and an analysis of an old era idea, using scenery that rivals classics like Playtime, and a cast that was clearly hand-picked with stars like Margot Gosling and Farrell. The movie features an astonishing soundtrack, including Ice Spice, Dua Lipa, Tame Impala, Billie, and much more. Barbie's presentation is top-notch, and some might even say it couldn't be any better (I would've agreed). However, the writing itself doesn't quite match its other impressive traits. Despite adapting the boring and monotonous toy line into something actually interesting on the big screen, it felt throughout the movie that the ideas of the writers were too disjointed. This led the director to piece together a self-exploration story with a modern world outlook, topped with media manipulation and a critique of society from a male perspective, with a side dish of a womanly critique of society. Safe to say, not every point got across as intended.",1
"7.5/10
First of all, I really loved this movie. I think it's fun and entertaining and I really think it's done with a lot a passion for the original material. The references are clever and I couldn't help but smile each time I saw a Barbie I had as a child (specially Midge!! I loved her). It's a very colorful movie and it's so refreshing to see that, specially with all the ""gray"" movies we get nowadays. The characters in Barbie land are fun and innocent, it really captures the joy of a child playing with the dolls even in the way it's filmed, the way the characters and objects move and even the houses are just like the ones you could play with as a child. Plus I really loved Ken and I think Ryan Gosling did a great job, he was hilarious. The Kens shenanigans were the best parts of the movie for me.",1
"The movie is very well produced in terms of art. The costumes are beautiful, such as the scenarios. When it comes to give us the impression of a ""toy world"", I give them a 10. Everything was very well thought out. The music scenes were also really good.",1
"While the Barbie movie delivers a range of colorful and diverse visuals, casting, and thematic concepts, it just fell short for me in the way of substance and execution, leaving me wanting more.",0
"I saw the trailer & had higher hopes. Visually interesting, what would Barbie be like if she existed in her own pink world. Who is a Ken in that world.",1
"I am not a huge Barbie fan. I want to say that right out of the gate. My mom, however, has a massive collection. She was at just the right age when the dolls came out that Barbie was a huge part of her life. Knowing that, I took her to see Barbie yesterday morning.",1
"The film's marketing portrayed it as a story about a doll entering the real world, but it surprisingly delves deeper into themes of feminism and patriarchy that were not adequately highlighted in the trailers. Had I not accidentally stumbled upon some spoilers before seeing the film, I would have been taken aback, expecting a more lighthearted and joyful adventure.",1
"When I first heard about the release of ""Barbie"" in 2023, I must admit I didn't have high expectations. After all, it's a movie based on a doll beloved by generations of young girls, and I wasn't sure how that would translate into a compelling cinematic experience. However, I was in for a pleasant surprise!",1
Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling deliver smashing performances. Title: Review,1
"Barbie was so much better than I expected it to be, I thought it would be fun but it definitely nailed everything it went for.",1
"One might think this is a girly movie made for teenage girls and may be the early 20s. It starts off misleading the audience into a fun filled ride of jokes and conscious silliness at the start. Later, as we all settle into the Barbie world, it slides in Feministic conversations. At one point you think whether it's an adaptation of ""Men are from Mars..."" book, because they hit you deeper than the laugh you make of the dialogue.",1
The first 5 min üëåüèΩ!!!,1
"It's a good movie, worth the watch but nothing special. It was really overhyped worldwide and although it's a good movie, it's nothing special. I believe standards have gone up in recent times and movies are getting better, and this is below that. However it tells an important story, and is a somewhat fun and education movie. I would rate it 6.5-7/10. Even though it's a ""Barbie"" movie, kids under probably 13 wouldn't understand the movie well. The moral of the story isn't just Barbie's and their fun little world. It's somewhat serious, and kids would only see the Barbie part, and not understand the point of the movie.",1
"I believe that everyone who said it was preachy just doesn't get it, the joy and pain this movie brought me makes it such a wonderful piece of art. The pacing of the movie was excellent as well. I never found myself checking the time waiting for it to end, i was engaged throughout. The comedy in the movie is very well done it felt fresh and not coming across as trying to hard. For me the best part was the end, that beautiful montage of women the cast and crew submitted to remind us that these women are all around us everyday and that we need to love eachother most of all. I will definitely watch it again.",1
"First, no actress on earth could have done this role other than Margot Robie. She's as if Barbie came to life (spoiler alert-she does). Margot is incredible in this. From the 2001 inspired opening (which had me laughing my head off) to when she's depressed and appears to be Barbie left behind by a little girl. The stiff legs, the arms, the way she rolls over-hysterical. The rest of the cast, especially America Ferrara, carry the story well and no one, no one is laughing at being in the movie. There are many, many Barbie related easter eggs, including one my wife pointed out to me: The interior of America's car is the same color as one of the original Barbie cars. The movie is fun without being preachy and if you pay attention-you may just learn something. One last thing, the great Dame Helen Mirren narrates! Go see it and have fun.",1
"This movie is an intelligence test. I saw many comments how people're describing the movie attacks men. It actually doesn't. I am a man, maybe even a stereotypical one - I loved Sigma Ken part, it was hilarious. I have a degree in Economics and love to work out in the gym, watching action movies, dark jokes, drink not cheap beers...",1
"Me and my sister both enjoyed this film and disliked it. The beginning of the film starts off with little girls destroying baby dolls because the new ""barbie toy"" had been created. Me and my sister were shocked and also disappointed in the scene. The movie was really funny, it had us laughing a lot and we enjoyed it. They made men look absolutely stupid, as in if there was just one leadership position filled by a man it was the end of the world. That part annoyed us and we strongly disagreed w it. Overall, i think that the movie could have been better, but it wasn't the worst i've ever seen. I definitely enjoyed certain moments of watching the film, but definitely not every moment. I recommend this film for the barbie world experience. I think every actor/actress fulfilled the role they played. However i don't think that the story was 100% in line and think it could have been a bit better. :)",1
The movie starts with the presentation of iconic barbie world and hilarious childhood references but it gets progressively deeper.,1
"I have seen a better movie than I expected. The cast was really good and also the dialogue helps a lot. There was not anything ridiculous, as I expected, and the actors did the best work in order to create a mix between comedy and drama. The story is ready to shock you and the lines are both funny and touching. The movie made me think about How Grinch stole the Christmas and The Truman Show.",1
"Clever, funny, charming with bright bold colors and visually stunning. But that is what I heard going into the film and I was not disappointed in any way in that area. The sets are also amazing and the Barbie worlds they created vs. The fake real world sets that they made; really cool.",1
The trailers and marketing for the movie were so good that I was really disappointed when the movie took an odd turn after 20-30 minutes into it.,1
"A breath of fresh air from almost all movies made in the past 10 years. Great acting, amazing set designs and a wonderfully interesting story with a few twists! I've been so turned off with many of the movies made in the past 10 years due to poor storylines, and an extreme over abundance of CGI, which I'm guessing most people like because that's the bulk of movies nowadays. This movie had me smiling or laughing most of the time, with a few heartfelt moments which brought a tear or two to my eyes. Congratulations to the writer, producer, Director and cast as it was an amazing movie all around - loved it.",1
"I watched the Barbie movie a few weeks after it came out, so I was expecting to experience all the emotions people raved about on Twitter. Overall I thought the movie was well-produced, but I think its marketing was misleading. Now, I know that this movie couldn't be marketed in a way that was truthful to the plot because less people would go to watch; people wanted to see a movie about the bright and bubbly character of Barbie, not a Barbie whose whole persoality is a complete 180 from her original. With that being said, I think the message the mvoie was getting at of how people should be free to be who they are and not conform to society's standards, etc is nothing we haven't heard before, which brings up the question of did we really need a movie to tell us this? Another question I have is why did Ken have a song? It didn't benefit the plot but that can be left to your own volition. I wouldn't say I was disappointed in this movie, but I think it was overhyped just a little bit.",1
"This movie is an easy 10/10 for me, did not disappoint. The casting, the directing, the plot, the cinematography, the sets, the detail, the acting, the jokes, it was all perfect. I want to rewatch this movie already! I watched it with my family and it is definitely enjoyable for everyone, the kids might not understand the movie as much but my sibling still really enjoyed it. This movie made me laugh and cry, it focuses on womanhood and mother daughter relationships in both a light hearted and sad way. I have absolutely no complaints about this movie whatsoever, absolutely loved it and recommend.",1
"This movie was an absolute hoot at my screening! A week after it's release, my theater was packed with people, laughing and clapping throughout the whole film. It was a great experience, and I really enjoyed the movie. Michael Cera was probably my favorite actor along with Ryan gosling and surprisingly Kate McKinnon. The story and adventure was really fun, I was absolutely in love with the visuals throughout the film, and I thought the self awareness was really refreshing. The music also energized the film throughout. With all that being said, I did have two complaints. The first is that the conclusion of the movie is that men and women can't work together, and I think that was a really strange choice. I understand that the movie wanted to empower independence but collaboration is also very important. Second complaint, why the heck was there a Chevrolet commercial in the middle of the movie? Anyways loved the movie and can't wait to see what Greta Gerwig does next.",1
Barbie is a vibrant and subversive film brought to life by Greta Gerwig with infectiously chaotic energy. The production design is exquisite and the cast is absolutely stacked with great actors and great performances.,1
"I really enjoyed this movie. Every Barbie that I grew up with gets featured (No, I did not own them all). I love the story and the fact that all ages can get something out of it, which made it feel even more relateable.",1
This movie was supposed to be fun light hearted watch but turns into an obnoxious headache filled with political message on and on and on.,0
Wasn't sure how good this film was going to be but the trailer suggested something magical and the film fulfilled my vision. Congrats to the director who's also the writer with her husband I believe. To the great production design. To the actors especially Margot Robbie and Ryan gosling who continues to amuse and surprise with his ability to switch characters and add humor and a little bit of fun to his roles. And he gets to sing again. Recommend for all ages really but certainly any kid that's over eight or nine should be able to understand half of what's going on and the parents or friends can explain the rest. Enjoy.,1
"I'm not sure what the writers and director are trying to say with this film, but I'm certain that it is 100% a vehicle to sell all the iterations of the boys' and girls' dolls and all their accessories.",0
"The Barbie Movie stars Ryan Gosling (Ken), Issa Rae (President Barbie), Margot Robbie (Barbie), Will Ferrell. (Matel CEO), Simu Liu (Ken), and Kingsley Ben-Adir (Ken).",0
"I Will keep this as spoiler free as possible. When I heard Greta Gerwig was directing the Barbie movie. I was instantly excited to the fear of everyone around me. I would tell them ""Greta Gerwig wouldn't do a superficial Barbie movie it would be more, it would have message."" To my surprise it was all of that and more! It was funny and clever. It showed the problems with Barbie (the toy) but also the dreams for Barbie for young girls. It was campy in the best way. And America Ferrera's monologue deserved a standing ovation and I even teared up a few times. So please ignore the low dumb reviews and go see the movie and make up your own opinions. At least for me it was delight to be seen and I hope you feel the same.",1
"I didn't get emotional whilst watching the movie, but hours later when i looked back on how special this movie is for EVERYONE, especially young girls and women.",1
"I enjoy the time watching this, because the details are there and represent a lot the experience we all live in our time. Besides the work of ryan and margot in this movie conveys a higher level of feeling, a feeling you can't describe, you feel the conection between them and you. It really argues about feelings and social deconstruction, and in the work doesn't show a treat any of the genders superior to others, in reality there is a dependency between genders that is easily evidenced, talks about the importance of knowing how to value oneself as a person and it is evidenced in the relationship between Barbie (Margot) and Ken (Ryan), in which Ken has a dependency on Barbie in which he cannot exist without her, which is reflected in our society.",1
"With some of the greatest casting seen in a film (looking at you, Alan), this film was bound to be an enjoyable watch. Maggot Robbie plays her role with a sense of misplaced optimism, anxiety and true ennui. She questions her place in a world she no longer understands and brings us with her to find out. Ryan Gosling goes on his own journey of self discovery, understanding and empathy. Incredible costumes, sets, choreography and songs are a joy to behold on the screen. Great Gerwig expertly navigates complex topics with warmth and compassion, making us all wonder if the power of Barbie can truly help to heal the real world.",1
"Barbie has captured many nuances of the societal stereotypes, challenged these tenets with a tactful yet fun twist. The main standout truly is the costume design. Highly diverse yet coherently put together to honor the Barbie concept. Borrowing elements from the Chanel's haute couture collection, to some of the rarest outfits from Barbie, it was such a unique experience to observe such understated works of art; even the extras/minor characters were wearing beautiful pieces. Some of the best costume design I've seen over the years.",1
I thought the movie was amazing. Full of nuances.,1
"I am in my late thirties, i had many Barbie's when growning up (still have a lot of them stored away, maybe it's time to get them out) and when i heard a Barbie movie was being made, i was like not another dumb remake that will fail like so many money grabs nowadays.",1
"It's weird yet fun movie! It keeps getting better by the minutes, had a good portion of fun but also a few emotional moments.",1
"This movie captures the frustrating yet wonderful feeling of being a woman in this world more than any other film I feel so seen and acknowledged. I ended up crying as the credits rolled just because I felt like all the emotions I couldn't put into words and no one could ever understand were said in this film. This is a movie for everyone, not just women, it makes us reflect about power roles and how we should all work together towards a more equal world for all.",1
"The acting was amazing. Ryan Gosling should win an award for this. There was much laughter, tears, dancing, and conflict which all played out well. The acting resembled the characters as toys, down to every little detail. Phenomenal acting! The movie shows that Barbie and Ken, and the other characters have been completely thought out. The development was very deep and relates to the audience very well. The dialogue was great, too, as there was just enough of it, showing depth. Ties into the plot and theme thoroughly.",1
"Barbie was by far one of the best movies i've watched in 2023. From the acting to the costumes, it was all just so amazing. I have no words to express how i feel after watching Barbie. It had to much emotion built into it. Margot Robbie had such a speechless performance. Greta Grewig is the writer and director that can make a movie that has so much emotional value and meaning. It gives you a look into being a woman and the struggles but also about finding who you are as a person. I enjoyed this movie like no other it was hilarious and an emotional rollercoaster. I hope we can see a sequel to Barbie. The movie deserves all the love. Go watch it now!!!",1
"Storyline: 8.5- Great story, could've been fleshed out in some areas to have even more overall connection, but it makes overall sense. A little silly at times; but I'm not complaining, I mean it is a story about Barbie. Pacing was good and easy to follow. It is, in my opinion, the perfect movie length, at an hour and 54 minutes.",1
I expected this movie to be more lighthearted and it had heavy themes and material. The first half hour or so was ok and had some funny moments but the second half just wasn't enjoyable to me. The writing was not good story telling and felt more like a number of speeches. I found it hard to watch honestly.,0
"I wanted to see this movie since the set pictures got leaked. Once they released the trailer and the clips, it was one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me.",0
"I'm not a Barbie fan girl in the least, but I think this has become one of those movies I will cherish. Those who were offended that they stereotyped men and made so many of them ""weak"" or ""stupid"" in this movie are seriously missing the point. They stereotyped it all (women included) in a way that was very intentional and drove home some incredibly difficult aspects of the modern human condition. They took impossibly stressful expectations that society pushes on both sexes and made them light hearted and surprisingly emotional. As a woman, even though the situations with men in the movie were exaggerated and oversimplified, they were all incredibly reflective of so many of the experiences that I and countless other women have lived through. It was nice to be seen (and to be able to laugh and cry at how on point they were)... I very rarely feel that from a movie, much less from a movie about dolls that I hardly ever chose to play with as a kid. I think the only thing I was hoping for more of was a greater acknowledgment of some less binary identities. In my opinion there were so many opportunities to more than subtlety hint at diversity there. Either way I'm pleasantly surprised at the entertaining way they tackled serious issues, how they incorporated pop culture, and how they both gave homage to the history and aesthetic of Barbie without hiding from some of the dark aspects of Mattel's past.",1
My mom aunts and my sister and my cousin Emily and Maddie grew up with Barbie and Ken for almost their entire childhood to adulthood. After seeing the Barbie movie it made me laugh and see what it's like to grow up with a doll that my sis played with all the time when I was a toddler . I remember my sis having a giant Barbie toy when she was about 4 and she played with her all the time and dressed her with her clothes . But now that Barbie reached theaters my sis and mom realized Barbie is more then just a toy she's the fashion model to all Barbie's from the 60s 70s 80s 90 2000s to now .,1
"I saw this movie a month ago and I've had a hard time gathering my thoughts for a review. I think that I need to give it another watch. That being said, my reaction from my first viewing is mixed.",1
"""If you brought a 7 year old girl to see this movie she would neither have fun nor be happy at all""
And this was my girlfriend's statement as soon as we left the cinema.",1
"I've given it 10 (although it's not far off) just to make up for the silly reviews on here giving it low scores because it's so ""preachy"". Well, you've completely missed the point of this film (and the Barbie brand altogether).",1
"Firstly, let's just say that I am not in the ideal demographic for 'Barbie', being male, 66 years old, and I don't have children, so it's taken me a while to get to this film. Anyway, what a lot of fun this film is. The concept works brilliantly and it's all carried through with self effacing charm and humour that both wins you over from the start , opening wonderfully with a parody of 2001, and then keeps you engaged throughout. Margot Robbie is perfect in the lead and Ryan Gossling couldn't be better as Ken (or one of the many Ken's), and the whole thing chugs along effortlessly and humorously. The idea of the conflict between the wonderfully created female world of Barbieland and the male dominated real world is milked for all it can give, with director Greta Gerwig hardly missing a trick. On so many levels this is a clever and tremendously entertaining film and I really loved it - even an old guy like me....",1
"Pretty simple. Anyone trying hard to explain why this movie would be any less than 8 stars is trying too hard to be a fake internet movie critic. Thoughtful, quirky, funny, fresh.",1
"Everything is perfect in Barbieland. Every day is identikit pink perfection for all the Barbies, and also for the Kens as long as they're getting attention. Then stereotypical Barbie starts getting dark thoughts, which can only be due to the human who is playing with her in the Real World. So, accompanied by Ken, Barbie sets off through the rip in reality to find the relevant human, only to find that the Real World is not at all like Barbieland. And Ken discovers patriarchy. And horses.",1
"The absolute best thing about this movie, is that it drives *exactly* the right people up a wall. In truth, it is neither as frivolous as it outwardly appears, nor nearly as socially progressive as it wants to be. And it's certainly not as clever as it thinks it is. Supporting characters played by Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell are basic, and frankly unnecessary. As for the humor, only a few lines land. ""I'm a man without power, does that make me a woman?"" was one of the few. The 2001 opening was cute. The railway joke I'd seen on social media, and thought that was good, but in the film it just felt like they were trying a little *too* hard to be clever. I appreciate it, but I just don't feel they committed enough to that tack.",1
"This film had to be more than advertising Mattel's famous doll, which set the standard for playthings fifty-odd years ago. And getting Greta Gerwig to direct a movie about Barbie, seems to have been a creative masterstroke. As expected, she has delivered a stylish incarnation of the sometimes much-derided doll, and it's a fun movie that carries its serious message quite lightly.",1
"When I watched the trailer for the first time, I wasn't sure if I would want to watch the movie, but all the great marketing and internet hype made me excited so I watched it, and I couldn't be happier! I have to say that at least every girl should watch this movie!!!",1
"Let's just get it out of the way, I freaking love Barbie. So many memories and ideals are connected to her that even without the movie I still get nostalgic about. The iconography, the looks, Ken (~swoon~)... there was one problem though, I am a boy, I could never get a Barbie because my parents never would let me have one. Instead I stole my cousins mermaid Barbie and treated her like one of my most precious toys until she disappeared, perhaps she went into Barbieland? Greta Gerwig's movie seemingly let us tap into all of that and more thanks to a great PR team that I haven't seen work their magic since a long long time, in other words hype has been BUILT. How does it fare? I left the cinema with a smile but I wish that it could have something MORE. Let me explain down below.",1
"Under the direction of Greta Gerwig, Barbie (2023), featuring Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and America Ferrera, delivers a charming escapade into the whimsical world of Barbieland. The film showcases commendable performances, humorous moments, yet falls short due to an average storyline that could have benefited from less emphasis on challenging societal norms.",1
"As I said at the beginning of the article, I lost my expectations before watching the movie because of the trailers. It felt like they were going on a story, especially one that would end up with big problems in the future. I will continue to watch an average movie when the analogies made on the internet seem to confirm my suspicions. But Barbie is hiding with a pretty well-written script. He uses drama in the parts that should be serious, and humor in the parts. From that moment on, the script can be both preserved and conveyed to the audience much better. Moreover, when the editing is at a fluent pace, you watch the movie breathlessly. The fact that its duration is under two hours is also nice considering the length of mainstream movies in recent years.",1
So it looks and sounds amazing but what's the story? Or should I say whys the story. There's just no point whatsoever to this weird story. And that's all I want to say. Go watch it for the costumes and sets but don't take any notice if what they say. So it looks and sounds amazing but what's the story? Or should I say whys the story.

"BARBIE is a great example of hype over substance. It is laugh out loud at times and Gosling steals every scene he's in. The art direction is on point. What makes it tiresome is THE MESSAGE pummelled into the audience, but then were we expecting any subtly? Probably not. Ultimately my wife just thought, 'I already know this. I don't need to hear it. But maybe some women do?' I get her point. In the end it felt like we were being sold Barbie Dolls as some kind of icon of feminism. But seriously, they are a very poor example of female role models. Not surprisingly Mattel was one of the producers.",1
"This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from ""Barbieland"" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.",1
"It definitely lived up to my expectations. Walking into the theater I was scared. Considering all the amazing marketing and promotion for this movie, it could've been easily disappointing, but it wasn't for me. The acting was amazing, the jokes and dialogue were funny, but most importantly, it had a message and they stick to it throughout the movie. I don't think the world is ready for a film centered around women, maybe it's too soon. I think some men will wrongly assume that it is an ""anti-men"" movie and they will hate it for it. It's far from that. My hope is that, with time, people will understand its message and realize that we're all Kenough.",1
"Let's face it: this film is not supposed to be good. It certainly isn't supposed to offer much more than eye-candy and a few songs. Yet, 'Barbie' in its own way has come to house all the pieces we look for in a movie. For her first live-action story, Greta Gerwig managed to craft an experience that captures everything right, and everything wrong with what the doll has represented to generations of girls. Set design was a dream and at opening feels like the first time we saw Dorothy step into Oz. The cast carried a full load of heavy-hitters and Gosling's Ken made a few attempts to steal the show. Margot Robbie is the true star that shines as she gives much more attention, depth, and charisma than Barbie had any right to be - creating a 3D character that is both whimsical and disturbingly real. Although it is an entirely different think-piece to discuss gender roles, the fact remains that any authentic Barbie story cannot be told without it. Gerwig's real genius is that she is able to tell the story within the story without it feeling like a finger-wag. The fact is, the pacing and humor is more than enough for viewers to see themselves on both sides of the fence. Cunning, sharp, heartfelt, and hilarious, 'Barbie' is an open love letter to past, present, and future mothers and the ties that bind through the obligation of perfection. In the end - like its namesake - the film represents whatever you want it to be. After all, isn't that what she was made for?",1
"The real world depicted in the movie is strangely devoid of normal people - everything looks fake and staged when Barbie goes to the real world. There are not enough extras in the real world scenes to make it look normal. I understand the filmmakers were attempting to make a statement about women's rights, etc., but it is done is such a heavy handed manner that it comes off as very forced. The costume & production design plus the glitzy choreographed numbers are not enough to make up for the missing substance of Barbie's need to figure out why her life feels wrong. The scene with the ghost felt like something stolen from the Matrix where Neo visits the oracle in the kitchen. This movie was overhyped & got us all to take the bait to see it & it made a billion $. I feel taken and bewildered that anyone enjoyed this - the movie felt very disturbing to me in a way I can't articulate.",0
"Who'd have thought that you could make a film about the Barbie doll. Well Greta Gerwig obviously did and what a rip-snorting entertaining piece of colourful fun it is. And on so many different levels too: socio-political commentary, gender roles, off-the-wall mayhem to mention three. There are homages to classic films from the very start that had me rolling with laughter, and it never let up.",1
"I really liked the movie. Without going into too much detail, I was surprised when I realized the movie was made more for us who played with the Barbies way back in the day. You think it's directed at the younger generations but it actually fits since even my own daughter never wanted nor played with a Barbie. I myself had the entire entourage,(and still have them, almost 40 years later) so it was much more endearing and relatable. I liked the underlying themes, which added depth and perspective that I didn't expect at all. I think that taking very complex and deep topics about societal issues and trying to keep them light is quite often better than delving too deep into these topics . It gives people a chance to think, feel and relate to it, without having the movie become too heavy, or being 'too much'. People that thought it was confusing probably didn't understand that the movie intended to keep it lighthearted for this very reason. I recommend seeing it, especially if you have a Barbie still tucked away on your closet, too.",1
My daughter came home from university for Christmas break and wanted to watch the Barbie movie so we rented it from Amazon and had a family movie night. It was better than I was expecting but in my opinion still a little bit over-rated. At almost two hours it was a bit long. The first hour was fun and had me laughing; the second hour - to me at least - started to drag a bit. But it's an enjoyable watch for the most part and leaves me shaking my head the the right-wing menfolk who seemed to think this movie was the end of civilzation as we know it. That says more about their own sense of masculinity than about the quality of the movie.,1
"Welcome back, Streamers! The most anticipated movie weekend of 2023 is here. It's Barbenheimer. If you haven't followed it, there's this ridiculous internet debate over which film will reign supreme between Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer...",1
A story that explores Mattel that manufactured the barbie dolls Margot and Ryan Gosling steal the show and are phenomenal in this as well as the supporting cast having a satisfying amount of screen time which gives everyone a moment to shine the soundtrack is great and really adds to the world of barbie highlights was Will Ferrel he also shined in this and made some great moments as well as Alan played by Michael Cera who I haven't seen in anything for ages and it was good to see them again greta gerwig did an amazing job with this movie and hit out the summer blockbuster of the year with this I give this a solid 8.5/10.,1
I can only recommend to see this joyful movie with an incredible cast.,1
I am a big movie fan and watch a wider variety of movies. I sit through nearly every movie I begin watching because in most cases there is a twist or a catch at the end that explains weaknesses of the movie in the beginning.,0
"I had good expectations from this movie but I decided to watch Oppenheimer in theatres instead of this. As the movie has hit digital, I watched it.",1
I couldnt wait for this to come out and when it did i saw it on the day of the release and ohh my everyone clapped and cheered at the end and in the uk no one ever does that but anyway i went with boys and girls and all of them enjoyed it i think truly it puts a message forward which might sound cringe but i dont care but everything about it was so good the acting was phenomenal the casting was amazing the cinematography the music just so good oh my god ive seen it a couple of times now and each time i finished the movie i was so happy for the rest of the day i was dancing and skipping around anyway i love this movie a lot.,1
"Boring uninteresting movie, it was fun at the beginning but the on going topic about feminism ruined the movie, felt unnecessarily long. Don't really recomend.",0
"Hello,
Upon watching ""Barbie,"" directed by Greta Gerwig, I was immediately struck by the breathtaking visual spectacle the film offers. The vibrant universe and the ensemble cast, led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, transported me through a range of emotions. Robbie, in particular, impressed me with her charisma and depth.",1
"Well, English is not my first language so I'll try my best here.",1
"Barbie is living a perfect life in her Barbie world filled with Barbies and Kens. Without the fear of change and the assurance of perfection, Barbie gets through the day partying until she starts thinking about death. Fearing malfunction, she is asked to visit the Real World to find her human pal to resolve the issue and get back to her perfect life. Ken follows her to the Real World where both come across patriarchy, which overwhelms them. When Barbie returns back to her world, she realizes what she is about to lose and how Barbie along with the other Barbies, couple of humans and an Allan, work together to save their world forms the story.",1
"I never had high expectations for the film due to the number of just-okay films that have come out this past year, but Greta never disappoints- Lady Bird, Little Women, and now Barbie! The movie is surely a Gerwig classic. It is amazing how the outright un-serious, campy film is able to tackle such serious and complicated real-world issues. Naturally, there is a satirical exaggeration of society to convey the point of the story but was executed with a conceptually clever approach. The writing carried witty humor, strong character development, and heartfelt experiences- all shined ever so brightly with the array of superb performances. Margot Robbie's performance throughout the film revealed the depth of such a character that can often be seen as superficial. The same can be said for Ryan Gosling's Ken. (SPOILERS) It is clear that everything Ken has done to Barbieland (""bringing patriarchy"") was in a way to shape his own sense of identity and self worth, what he feels he often lacks in Barbieland. The film features a multitude of well-known actors that portray a great deal of what a Barbie can be. The set and costumes bring viewers the nostalgia of their childhoods and how this life in a Barbie dream house (and her clothes) were extremely coveted by young girls. On the other hand, it shows how Barbieland is not all it is thought out to be. I was pleasantly surprised at how the dance numbers were reminiscent of old Hollywood sound-stage musicals that we never really see anymore. This film review would not be complete without an honorable mention to America Ferrera's performance. Her monologue's feminist themes are reminiscent of Saorise Ronan's monologue from Little Women. It was delivered at just the right pacing and intensity, resonating with audiences. While the message is not at all new, many women especially feel heard. The film does a wonderful job of blending the inclusive comedy with previous or subsequent scenes that make viewers tear up- the simultaneous laughing and crying sort. Overall, ""Barbie"" is a fun, glittery, social commentary satire about female identity; the feminism of hyperfemininity, authenticity, and community; and what it means to be human in our messed-up, chaotic world. For the Gerwig fans, Barbie lovers, Barbie haters, and everyone else, go watch Barbie.",1
"So i've just got back from theaters and all i got to say is wow, that was such a fun, funny, charming movie and the Barbie world was just so colorful ! ( which we knew from the trailers )",1
Barbie was a fun movie and it visually looked really original. There were some really funny parts and some good acting. I loved some of the throwbacks and songs. Really was laughing at some of the funny moments.,1
"As the film's trailer suggests, whether you like or dislike Barbie dolls and merchandise, there's still plenty of things to enjoy about Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie."" Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are brilliantly cast as Barbie and Ken where they both have awesome chemistry and share plenty of hilarious moments on-screen. I should also add that Gosling delivers what's probably one of the best musical solos of the year next to Jack Black's performance in The Super Mario Bros Movie.",1
"Hilarious, great comedic timing. Loved it. Welldone Margot and Ryan! Hilarious, tear jerking, heart warming. Ticked all the boxes.",1
"I'm sorry if there are some mistakes in this, english isn't my first language. This is seriously one of the funniest movies i've ever watched. I laughed everytime Ryan Gosling was on screen, he was my favorite in this movie. The only thing i would say wasn't the absolute best was the storyline. I felt like it was like 3 stories all in one movie and they shifted to those stories really fast. I did like the feminist vibe because it was all without hating on men. I think this would be a perfect movie for everyone. In my theater it was mostly young females tho, but i don't think it's made only for them!",1
Barbie is a film that on the outside appeals to a younger audience but it is certainly much more mature in overall nature.,1
"Never have i seen a film on the silver screen as loud and as proud of its feminist message as Barbie. Most movies half ass it, you can put the same recycled messages that are surface level in meaning and still pander to the male audience, cause no one's gotten the guts to actually give us a film with a story and characters that's truly for women. But that's just what Greta Gerwig does. This film wonderfully balances comedy and emotion, you'll be laughing as much as you'll be crying, especially if the message of this film speaks to you. A colorful set design devoted to capture the accuracy of playing with barbie dolls, a beautiful collaboration between several female artists, empowering the film's core of exploring one's identity as a woman in a male dominated society, and the talent of the film's lead actress, Margot Robbie along with the rest of the cast ties this film together into Movie of The Century.",1
"We all knew barbie was going to be funny. We all knew it'd have something to say about the ""female coming-of-age,"" as all of greta gerwig's movies have thus far. And we all knew margot robbie and ryan gosling would turn in note-perfect performances as barbie and ken. And they did.",1
"I really wasn't sure what to expect, but thoroughly enjoyed this film. Some very strong performances and not just Ryan Gosling, despite what most reviews say, but of course any film with Helen Mirren, (even as 'only' narrator) has kudos to begin with. A fun film that makes you think as an adult, but that kids will also enjoy. I went with my 19 year old daughter and we laughed out loud and shed an unexpected tear. Music is upbeat, choreography is very slick, colours vibrant and the fulm is surprisingly well shot. Hats off to Mattel for taking the plunge and goning with it. Well worth any price of admission.",1
"Barbie is one of those few films that are able to merge an extremely unreal and borderline bizarre environment with an immensely grounded and hyperreal take on society successfully, and still be massively entertaining.",1
It's weird seeing a movie that puts gay male culture front and centre of a lesbian-free world.,0
This movie has such a powerful message for women everywhere! The set is amazing and the movie is so funny. The writing is so clever and funny! It made me feel so powerful and validated! I really enjoyed it! Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie! And Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken! I feel like the chemistry between them and all of the other Barbies and Kens were great! I loved how there were different type of Barbies in the movie! Being a woman is amazing and powerful and I hate how the world doesn't respect us or take us seriously. There was some slow parts and jokes that didn't land for me but overall it was a great film!,1
"Haters can hate all they want. It's a brilliant movie. I could not have asked for anything more. In 2023, We live in a complex society with extreme sexism which has been brilliantly addressed by none other than Barbie! The last Product that one would expect to address this issue. Was it perfect, no- nothing is perfect today. It didn't cover many topics. But did it do an excellent job at covering the topic they decided to address - absolutely YES! They can take my money - again and again for creating content that is relevant and important and changes all our perspectives. The cast was brilliant. I can't believe how many people they roped in. And Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were AMAZING as Barbie and Ken.",1
"I grew up watching Barbie, my kids watched every Barbie movie. This was AWFUL! Extremely dumb, language was uncalled for (mother Bleep, vagina, penis, I'd like to see the blob in his jeans), on top of Mattel being made something it isn't. Where are all the other Barbie characters? Ryan, Raquelle, Summer, or her little sisters? At many points I was either yawning or asking myself why am I continuing to sit through this? I took up for the movie and told people it couldn't be that bad they were just being too judge-mental. Na I was wrong! It's terrible and I can't say that enough. You failed us!!",0
"I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was amazing. I just thought it was too on the nose. Like the message was literally forced in your face. It seemed lazy to me. I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6/10. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy. Ultimately, it's nice movie to see and I'd see it again at some point but it wasn't great.",1
"As one of the most anticipated films of the year, Barbie has managed to meet all audience expectations -especially cinephiles - and make it the most daring film of the year. Director Greta Gerwig (supported by screenwriter Noah Baumbach) doesn't just deliver a successful portrayal of all aspects of this popular icon: colorful set designs, stunning costumes and make-up, great music (they all sing!), the history of the Barbie doll, but also social commentary and philosophical analysis on existentialism, patriarchy, feminism, diversity, inclusion and all that packaged in sarcasm in the modern sense. As a film, Barbie delivers it all: fun, excitement and seriousness. The casting of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken is also the right choice. Barbie reminds us again that summer box office hits can be really fun and good.",1
"This is the first time I've written a review for a movie, that should tell you that I enjoyed this movie an awful lot.",1
"""Barbie"" is a delightful film that successfully blends humor with a heartwarming message. The movie captures your attention with its witty moments and leaves you with a sense of positivity. The storyline, combined with the charming characters, draws you into Barbie's world and keeps you fully engaged throughout. While some aspects might be familiar, the film's unique twist and overall execution make it a standout. With its combination of humor and a touching message, ""Barbie"" earns a solid 8 out of 10 rating. It's a feel-good watch that's perfect for anyone seeking an enjoyable cinematic experience.",1
"I thought all the jokes were really funny and I felt a bit sorry for Ken while all the barbies rule barbie world all ken (Ryan gosling) wants is to be noticed by barbie (Margot Robbie) and when he goes to the real world and discovers that it's all about men and horses and he freaks out . I also loved the fact that all the barbies were not all skinny and blonde . I also thought that it was really sweet the way barbie met Ruth and Ruth was kind off like a mother to her and she helped her along the way in the movie . Everything was pink I can see how there was a shortage of pink paint . And it was really funny when the narrator was giving her opinion throughout the movie . So to all the cast, directors , singers , producers and people involved well done . It was amazing. And it will give girls a lot off confidence for a long time .üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè",1
"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""",1
"One must have a full understanding of American culture over the last 60 decades to really understand this film. The opening sequence, modeled after ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is extremely funny. And when Margot Robbie suddenly appears as ""Barbie,"" my first thought was: ""Now that is perfect casting.""",1
"This is unquestionably one of the worst films I've ever watched. When I found out Greta Gerwig wrote and directed it, that was the only reason I could even muster to try to watch it. I'm assuming that the whole concept was so dreadful chiefly because Mattel was one of the production companies behind it. As typically happens, heavily hyped films cannot live up to the flackery. This was no exception. I suppose it's possible I did not like it because I am not female and was not a child who spent much time playing with dolls, so I just cannot identify with the fantasy world it tries to create, or with the pseudo-feminist triumph storyline, which is not really all that triumphant in the end, though I hope the gist is that it does not need to be a triumph as much as it needs to be a catalyst for coequal cooperation.",0
"A confused, misfiring, tedious and pretentious affair. I was expecting much better, yet ultimately disappointed. Margot Robbie (and to a lesser extent, Ryan Gosling) is very good, but otherwise even she can't save this twaddle. Don't listen to the critics - it is crap!",0
"This one reminds me of why I love movies so much. Acting, dancing, visual arts, screenplay, plots, soundtracks, humor, moral, there are everything we need in a movie. What hit me the most is that I was only expecting the kind of adult humor in that Barbie song ""You can brush my hair undress me everywhere,"" but at some point I realize it's way more than that. The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it's so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it's so beautiful. Yet, it's such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything. It's a movie about love. I cried so hard and laughed so hard. It's a masterpiece.",1
"""Barbie the movie"" left me disappointed and unimpressed. The storyline felt overly simplistic, lacking depth and originality. The dialogue was clich√©d, often predictable, and failed to engage the audience. The characters seemed one-dimensional, and their development was superficial at best. The animation, touted as a highlight, fell short of expectations, lacking the polish and detail one would anticipate from a major production. Overall, it failed to capture the attention of both children and adults, making it a forgettable viewing experience. Even the scene with America Ferrera felt so forced and cliche and it fed on superficial emotions.",0
"The film's universe and settings are fantastic. The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.",1
"Good movie but nothing special. Good quality, funny and this all. After leaving the cinema, I had the feeling that I was watching a long corporate propaganda about Barbie. But that was probably it. Clearly Mattel wanted to improve the opinion of Barbie dolls based on feminist themes and the problem of gender inequality. However, there is a strong feeling that this topic was used as a marketing manipulation. Good cast and acting, film for both children and adults. Lots of references to barbie doll jokes. Margot Robbie played really great here, without her this movie would be much weaker.",1
"You've waited KENough for this! Barbie and Ken are having the time of their lives in the colorful and seemingly perfect world of Barbie Land. However, when they get a chance to go to the real world, they soon discover the joys and perils of living among humans.",1
Normally when a movie is hyped up big time you can pretty much guarantee it's gonna be rubbish.,1
"Too many sexual references and doesn't grasp the concept of barbie. The production and crew could have done a lot more with this movie to draw more attention. Like again I said in the title waste of time. With also not adding enough in the movie they have also tried too much on the set and dressing designs, but the cast for the movie was okay with me but instead of Ryan gosling as Ken Freddy Prinze Jr. Instead. With this movie I feel sad that production made this movie PG-13. Because the age group of people that lobve barbie are 5-9 year Olds. But parents can take their children to see babies but kids will not find it exciting with all of the adult jokes and references.",0
"Barbie is Gerwig-Lite: just far too self-aware for its own good, to the point where it feels like it was written explicitly to impress critics. Gerwig and Baumbach parrot out every single intersectional feminist talking point in the book in an effort to communicate to the audience, ""Hey, we're aware of the philosophical complexities of this issue but we're still having fun!"" Which, fine, but Gerwig has already probed the question of what it means to be a woman much more meaningfully in her previous films without the kind of extratextual baggage this resorts to; political astuteness doesn't make for very entertaining or memorable film dialogue.",1
"I had a feeling this movie would deliver from the surprising cast (not the sellout type) to the writers and director, it seemed set.",1
"To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. The movie starts fine which is more or less what was advertised in the trailers where the setting was Barbie. That was kind of fun. The problem is that the second part is just a mess in pace, it tries tooooo hard to be funny. The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly. It was nowhere close to be succint. All Pixar movies do a better job at making their point. And for me, the worst of all, is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic.",0
"Spoilers Ahead - Firstly Ryan Gosling was the only good thing about this film. The stupid thing is when Barbie went to the real world she hated how there were a lot of males in leadership positions, even though in Barbie Land it is entirely run by females and then wonders why Ken wanted to change things in Barbie land when she felt the same way as ken in the real world. This lead to ken being the villain and no it was not Will Ferrel character as the bad guy as he wanted to keep barbie land the way it was not to have ken take over so it was in fact ken to believed to be the bad guy. Then the really stupid thing comes at the end when she fights hard to change her home back into barbie land then decides to go and live in the real world which she hated because of the male dominance. Also the whole female don't have power thing is getting a bit old as these days there are strong powerful woman in successful leadership jobs.",0
I think the idea is great and all but honestly for a movie about feminism the most enjoyable parts were the ken parts and its nothing we've never seen/heard before you know. Like the whole speech part ive heard all that a million trillion times. I struggled so hard to get through the movie the plot was hard to follow and the 'barbieland' doesnt really make sense. I also thought some stuff was just ridiculous like how they travel to the 'real world'. And im saying this as a woman and all but i think they could of done such a better job with a feminst movie honestly. Idk how people were crying im sorry JSHDS.,0
"I'm only saying it could have been better because of the hype. I was expecting a little more and was a little disappointed by some aspects of the film. Firstly I'll say that Margot as Barbie and Ryan as Ken were great individually. A large part of why this movie was so good is because of what they brought to the characters and the story on screen. I found watching Ken discovering ""patriarchy"" to be the most hilarious part of the film. However, one of the first critiques I have is that it felt like the movie didn't spend enough time in Barbieland. The serious shift felt a little too sudden when it could have benefitted from fleshing out the ""perfect"" life a little more and the character dynamics of the barbies and Kens. This also would have made me personally feel more like I care as a viewer regarding the emotions and thoughts that Barbie and Ken were experiencing when they went to the real world. Secondly, it's use of heavily weighted political words being used loosely by the barbies and kens water down the overall issue this film is trying to be about. I think being a woman in the real world is a lot more complicated than going on a beach and getting harassed. Or seeing a bunch of men working and socialising in corporate. I understand the way the movie addresses this is meant to be with a comical and somewhat obvious tone, and it was. However, it could have benefitted from also adding a bit more of a layered experience to these issues which would consequently add more dimensions to when these politically weighted words were used. It just felt, in my personal opinion, to be thrown around for the convenience of making a point amongst all the silliness but with no real material message. Finally, which brings me to my third critique, is that the movie didn't seem to be for kids but at the same time it was? My first argument for why perhaps the two critiques I have made might not be valid is because it's a kids film, and in that sense it would, well, make sense. But then there was the use of heavy political language used throughout the movie that just wouldn't be useful for a storyline in which kids can get the message, not to mention literal sexual reference made to female and male gentilia which seemed inappropriate for children. Don't get me wrong, I love when kids movies throw in a little something subtle for adults to obviously get a giggle at, which I argue Shrek did very well for example. However, the script of this movie (I'm not speaking of visuals for obvious reasons) just seemed a little confused in which age group it was catering too. Which arguably limited itself in diving deeper into the above two points I made.",1
About reality. None of the nonsense of ask the Barbie Movies. In all honesty it was about patriarchy and feelings being human. It was also about the relationship between children as they grow up and their toys. It would not be something i would expect to bring someone under the age of 13 to and expect them to be entertained. Very much more silly adult stuff than kids in the sense of being to understand.,1
"Barbie (2023) is a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig and co-written by her and Noah Baumbach, based on the iconic fashion dolls by Mattel. The film stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery after their expulsion from Barbieland, a matriarchal society where all women are successful and independent. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and surprises in the real world, a multifaceted exploration of existentialism, consumerism, and femininity.",1
"Honestly, this is the best movie I've ever seen. The roles are so perfectly played and everyone did such a good job on this movie. I love it so much, came with a bunch of friends, my mom, their moms, and my little sister. Everyone said that they lived the movie. The ending made me cry but in such a good way, like how Barbie was when she experienced sadness for the first time. Seeing a movie that doesn't have the patriarchy spreader all over it is so refreshing, and honestly, if you're mad at this movie, you might be part of the problem. Seeing Ruth appear and give Barbie a talk was so amazing and such an emotional experience. I loved it so much I can't even explain. Seeing women even in movies come together and address problems is so refreshing.",1
This was a totally enjoyable movie and it started off with like the planet of the apes with the old fashion girls with the old babies dolls. I was the generation that started with Barbie so I thought it was very entertaining and more importantly I thought the costumes were totally spot on for the Barbie character as well as the Ken character.,1
"Barbie offers a delightful and fun-filled experience, encompassing chuckles, joy, and, surprisingly, some deeper discussions surrounding its creation's intended impact on feminism versus the portrayal of opposing views on women in real life. It even delves into the influence of patriarchy, hyper-masculinity, and its effects on the mental and emotional struggles women face daily. Initially, I found myself a bit confused since it wasn't quite what I expected. The movie touched on dark themes like death, which left me wanting more answers, especially since it was mentioned often, but it didn't tie up that loose end.",1
"For a film like ""Barbie"" to succeed, every aspect had to come together perfectly. It needed to consummately balance satire with fun, the casting had to be spot-on, and the writing/directing required to pull off such a feat would need to be exquisite. Somewhat remarkably, that is exactly what writer/director Greta Gerwig pulls off here to create the best movie of summer 2023.",1
"It was a literal cinematic master piece. It was comedic, touching, educational, ground breaking.",1
"Barbie is one of the most iconic toys of all time! It genuinely baffled me that it took this long for there to be a Barbie film. Barbie isn't my thing, so I wasn't interested in watching this. It wasn't until the first trailer came out and the global internet cultural phenomenon ""Barbenheimer"", the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day, that my interest was piqued. So is life plastic, it's fantastic? Or is it just Ken?",1
"No Spoilers:
I went for my daughter and a social 'ladies night' function our local cinema does for certain releases (missed them since COVID).",1
I loved so much about this movie. From the costumes to the sets to the colors to the soundtrack to the excellent comedy. I also really loved the plot and takeaway of the film.,1
Annnd it was a lot of fun at the beginning but about the time Kate McKinnon came in the movie just died nobody laughed but one lady and she laughed at everything. It was fun but it was about 20 minutes to long for me could cut out most the stuff towards the end. I get it Barbie didn't realize that Ruth was her creator. I don't know if we really need the whole speech either everyone already knows what Barbie is they could cut some out of thst scene it felt like it dragged on a little bit to long. It was nice to see the daughter of the lady who was playing with Barbie turned out to be better then she was at the beginning acting all crazy. Idk this movie felt eh to me.,0
"This is not a great movie - when you get down to it, it's not even a good movie. It's a popcorn movie at best. The best thing it has going for it? Margot Robbie as Barbie: she does channel the role well and when her world turns upside down, you genuinely feel sorry for her. At the other end of the scale - Ryan Gosling as Ken. Gosling is good at stretching into roles, but no matter what - Ken was an androgenous doll and Gosling can't stretch the role anything more than that. He looks like a character out of ZOOLANDER and whenever he is on the screen, i was cringing in my seat. There are definitely funny moments: my favorite? When Ken runs into the ocean to surf. Definitely a woman's movie from the first preach to the final cast roll - it got old fast and the screenplay didn't seem to have much substance after the ""I am woman"" speeches. I thought it was me, but there was a lot of kids in the theatre and they all appeared to be bored as well. Sorry Greta => This is not your ticket to the Oscars.",0
"Barbie was one of the most anticipated films of the year 2023. Many people made fun of him believing that he would be lame, and other people believed that he could actually be very good because of the cast and direction. Is it rough? In a way yes. But it's deliberately lame, they're living puppets, it's obvious that this is lame. The big complaint about the film is about the critics, as many people found it exaggerated and indeed it is, but again, it's on purpose. The criticism works very well, the characters work, the universe built here is incredible. Visually it is one of the most beautiful films of the year, a world all pink could be very strange, but it turned out beautiful and very convincing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are very good and manage to hold your attention, on the other hand, when they try to focus on other characters, the quality is not the same. Some characters don't work, particularly the businessmen who are featured in real life. Overall, this film is great and has earned its place among the best and most memorable films of 2023.",1
First of all: Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie and I also loved the quirky colorful style of the movie from start to finish. Both the pink dominated Barbieland and also the transition over to the real world are well done in my opinion.,0
"I watched it twice in theaters and on Max and both times I had an incredible time. The message was great but could have been used a bit less as at its core it is a Barbie film. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did incredible in the film. I could tell they worked hard to make this film. The jokes land and the message sticks although feeling repetitive as the entire 3rd act was this. The soundtrack is incredible and I love how aqua was used for some songs. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. This is highly recommended to anyone who is yet to watch this. All in all this film is great, go watch if you haven't.",1
"Had another look at the Barbie film. The first impression is undoubtedly a great colourful story of Barbie finding herself in the world. But if you watch it again, more thoughtfully, opening your heart and mind, I'm afraid you will leave the cinema devastated and crushed.",1
POSITIVES:,1
"Went in to see for Margot Robbie, left giving flowers to Ryan Gosling",1
"""Barbie"" is a film that left me with mixed feelings. While it had its strengths, like Ryan Gosling's exceptional performance and emotionally impactful scenes, I found the film to be a bit overloaded with messages. Some parts were polarizing, and the humor occasionally missed the mark.",1
"I found the movie to be refreshing, but it's far from perfect.",1
"I was really looking forward this movie and my expectations were quite high actually so I was a bit scared to be disappointed but that wasn't the case at all. The movie is so funny, cute and smart at the same time, Meg does a wonderful job portraying Barbie's character, she was the perfect cast for the part. Ken was also really funny, plus the relationship of a mother and daughter was a really nice touch.",1
"At first, I didn't want to go on this film. Then I was drowned to the movie theater by the advertising campaign expecting something. But nothing is actually occurred.",0
Title: A Perfect 10: Barbie's Spectacular Movie Delights Audiences,1
"""Barbie"" may seem like an improbable concept for a thought-provoking film, but director Greta Gerwig skillfully harnesses this cultural icon to deliver a potent and profound message. Gerwig delicately weaves a narrative that explores the complexities of gender dynamics without vilifying either gender, demonstrating that Kens in Barbieland face similar challenges as real-world women. The film also touches on the importance of embracing diversity and dismantling societal barriers. The movie's production design deserves applause, staying true to the beloved Barbie toys while ingeniously utilizing their features to propel the story forward. Margot Robbie delivers a phenomenal performance as Barbie, injecting depth and nuance into a character often dismissed as one-dimensional. Ryan Gosling, as Ken, complements the film with his adept portrayal, enhancing the chemistry between the characters, while America Ferrera's character brings a layer of relatability to the story. Gerwig's clever balance of humor and poignancy ensures that the movie achieves its goal of raising awareness without alienating its audience. A delightful yet meaningful cinematic experience.",1
"The movie has embodied a very important social message in a very entertaining manner. There are layers of meanings to each scene and dialogue. Unlike other movies with a social message which are generally set in a very serious or boring tone, Barbie seems like a very refreshing watch. The comedy is on point. One observation after the movie was that many people missed the point of the whole movie. The message of feminism was wrapped in humour so well that many people missed the whole underlying message. The depiction also seemed a bit too complex to comprehend (which could be both a positive and negative thing).",1
